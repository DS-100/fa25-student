    "Write a SQL query to determine the movie producers with the highest average ratings across all of their movies. Define a **\"movie producer\"** as anyone with a `producer` job category role in a `movie` title type. Construct a query that generates a table consisting of the **producer's name** (as `name`) and their **average producer rating** (as `producerRating`), computed by rescaling the ratings for movies they produced by the number of votes received by each movie. After rescaling the score for each movie, divide the summation of all rescaled ratings by the total number of votes received by each producer. The formula is below:\n",

Present the producers with the **top 10** `producerRating` in **descending** order and break ties alphabetically using the producer's name.\n",
