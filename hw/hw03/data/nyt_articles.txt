The family was going around the table, suggesting what each thought the New Year\u2019s resolution should be for the other. Fei Fei\u2019s English was still shaky. When her turn came, though, she didn\u2019t hesitate.

But where do you start? This year, T wanted to come up with a new sort of cookbook list: one written by the cookbook authors themselves.

Through it all, my husband managed to carry on his Zoom conference call, as if the cacophony didn\u2019t exist. Theoretically, I was also working.

Free and easy to use, the services are gobbling up record numbers of new users.","65":"Ever since many of us started working from home in the coronavirus pandemic, I\u2019ve been invited to countless gatherings taking place on Zoom, the videoconferencing app. Virtual happy hours, work meetings, dinners, you name it.","66":"When the pandemic hit, we began gathering around the hearths of our screens, for news, or in solidarity with friends and family, for the cold solace of a cocktail-hour booze-Zoom, even for preschool, the grid of domestic scenes and small, hopeful faces meant to relieve us of our isolation somehow only succeeding in reinforcing it. (Even those of us who tend naturally toward solitary endeavors find ourselves running low on interiority these days.) Under normal circumstances, illness is a largely private event; even a common disease is suffered individually. But a pandemic isolates us collectively, as the grid illustrates almost too perfectly; we aren\u2019t alone in our loneliness. When we Zoom, we \"connect\" along our metaphoric edges. We\u2019ve existed in such grids for a while without really acknowledging it, one might argue, imprisoned in our small geometries of perspective. Grid life seems all too easy a metaphor for a society stripped bare, exposed for what it has become. But that\u2019s the thing about the grid; live with it long enough and one forgets it\u2019s there, until the next catastrophe.","67":"Over the last month, the Zoom videoconferencing service has emerged as the communication lifeline of the coronavirus pandemic. But the convenience fueling Zoom\u2019s explosive popularity has come at a price.","68":"We had our first Zoom Seder this week. I had never hosted Passover in my home, so we had zero essentials and, though I tried to get what I could at the store, a lamb shank is not easy to come by in this particular moment. So, my kids drew the big bone and the gefilte fish on a piece of paper, and my 3-year-old insisted on eating a tortilla with ketchup instead of matzo. We read from a PDF Haggadah I found on Reform Judaism dot org. And you know what? It was still pretty special.","69":"It\u2019s 8 a.m. as the two of us sign on to Zoom to discuss this article. Various Disney musicals blare in the backgrounds of both sides of our conversation as we sip our coffees and struggle to remember life before the coronavirus. Just weeks ago, the sight of our toddlers entranced by screens first thing in the morning would have caused panic. Now? It\u2019s a typical Tuesday. In fact, screens are on as we write this article. How else could we do it?","70":"Last week Angela Missoni took a walk in the garden of her house in Sumirago, a snug town in Italy about an hour northwest of Milan. After a month in isolation, a difficult morning on Zoom and a steady drumbeat of bad tidings for business, she needed some air.","71":"Confinement and social distancing mandates are taking a toll on business travel as airlines cut flight schedules and long-distance meetings are held with teleconferencing services like Zoom, putting cities around the nation in a bind.","72":"Like a lot of self-isolating people, Madisen Li is vacillating between nervous, bored, grateful and irritable.

At 30,000 feet, with nothing but a slow internet connection, they decided to get a head start by hacking Zoom, a videoconferencing service that they knew was used by many Dropbox employees.","77":"The activists popped into frame a few at a time, the shadowy rectangles of the videoconferencing app Zoom opening grainy windows into their kitchens, bedrooms and livelihoods. A chat icon at the bottom of the screen glowed orange as they said hello.","78":"Like many students who have shifted to remote learning, Leslie Novoa\u2019s three children are jumping on Zoom calls and missing their classmates.","79":"I had two Zoom meetings at the same time at the university where I work. I told my boss I wasn\u2019t sure how long the first one would last, but I doubted I would make his meeting. As it happened, the first one was short, so I popped into my boss\u2019s meeting. When I got there, my co-workers were screaming with laughter, and I heard my boss say: \"The other weird thing Lauren does is\u2026.\" But then he realized I was there and stopped. My co-workers looked uncomfortable, and my boss pivoted quickly by asking about my first meeting. I was mortified! It was all I could do not to cry. How can I find out what weird things I do, so I can stop? I don\u2019t want to be the office weirdo.","80":"SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As people turned in droves to the video chatting app Zoom in recent weeks, the buzz caught Facebook\u2019s attention. Inside the social network, that immediately set off a scramble.","81":"BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Sprawling banquets that convened crowds of relatives have shrunk to modest meals for immediate family. Imams who led prayers in packed mosques have been addressing the faithful over Zoom. And stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines have sapped the nighttime jubilance of cities with large Muslim populations, from Cairo to Jakarta to Dearborn, Mich.","82":"For the pandemic, Taylor Erkkinen, an owner of the Brooklyn Kitchen, has taken her cooking classes online. But, like the hands-on courses she was giving in her Industry City kitchen studio, they are limited to 20 students. They\u2019re held on Zoom so students can ask questions and get answers in real time. On Saturday at noon, she\u2019ll teach a brunch class with a menu of granola, poached eggs with hollandaise, hash, Dutch baby pancakes and Bloody Marys. Before you sign up, you are told what ingredients and equipment you\u2019re required to have on hand.","83":"Virtual coffees with college students for high school juniors. Zoom sessions between applicants and admissions officers. Student guides offering welcoming messages in video selfies and scenic views of university campuses captured by drones.","84":"Clint Smith, a writer, teacher and poet, dreamed for more than six years of the moment he would defend his dissertation. But instead of standing in front of his three committee members at Harvard University, Dr. Smith obtained his doctorate from his kitchen table in Maryland over Zoom.

Their faces arranged in a grid reminiscent of the game show \"Hollywood Squares,\" people are attending virtual happy hours and birthday parties, holding virtual business meetings, learning in virtual classrooms and having virtual psychotherapy.","86":"One Friday last month, Mike Hadreas fell asleep in a \"Cruel Intentions\" T-shirt and got up later that morning for a Zoom interview. He\u2019d been up late, in his Los Angeles home, so he took the call in bed. Not something he\u2019d normally do. The Zoom, the wee hours.","87":"The annual summer Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Colo., has been canceled. But the New York City Wine and Food Festival, a four-day fall fund-raiser that sprawls across the city in restaurants and event spaces? Not so fast. Lee Schrager, the organizer and founder, is going digital with it, starting this week, and still hopes the festival will return in October. (He was able to slip in the South Beach edition in Miami just under the wire in February.) Now with the gala atmosphere at tastings, lunches, cocktail gatherings and dinners falling victim to social distancing, the festival has added NYCWFF at Home, with sessions, mainly classes, featuring food celebrities and chefs a few times a week. Participants, up to 300 per session, pay $20 each and can join via Zoom. There will even be a 15-minute Q. and A. at the end of each event. All the money goes to the National Restaurant Association\u2019s Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. First up on Monday at 2:30 p.m. will be Neil Patrick Harris cooking with his husband, David Burtka; Wednesday will feature Alex Guarnaschelli and her daughter. Plans are for it to continue for months to come.","88":"I live in Beirut, Lebanon, but in this season of confinement I could be anywhere. I have left my apartment eight times in six weeks; my brushes with the city where I\u2019ve lived for a year and a half are so brief, I forgot that I lived near the sea until I went up on a roof and my eyes confronted the blue fact of the Mediterranean. In my apartment, with friends nine time zones away as accessible as friends down the block, I Zoom far and wide. I could be anywhere, but some part of me wants to be in New York.","89":"Had this been a normal spring, Emily Mann would have wrapped up her three decades as artistic director of McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J., in the traditional way, with colleagues and patrons gathered under a tent to toast her at a gala. Instead, on Saturday night, they gave her a virtual tribute on Zoom, which she watched, teary-eyed, from her living room.","90":"What could someone learn about you by visiting your home \u2014 or by seeing it in the background of a Zoom meeting or video call? Choose three objects and explain what each says about you.","91":"In the Great Lockdown, two-way video has become our primary social channel. Meetings, parties, concerts, music lessons, exercise classes: Any interactions that can be adapted to a Zoom video call, have been. Surely there\u2019s nothing left to be Zoomified.","92":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Christy Smith, a Democratic House candidate in suburban Los Angeles, had just finished a debate (over Zoom, of course) and was eager to point something out: First, President Trump had endorsed her Republican opponent, Mike Garcia. Then the president raised the specter of voting fraud, writing on Twitter: \"Turn your Ballots in now and track them, watching for dishonesty. Report to Law Enforcement.\"","93":"When everything began shutting down back in March, Steve Wiens thought he would be leading church via Zoom for two, maybe four, weeks.","94":"One day this quarantine, who can say which, I encountered the following pieces of information: Zoom, the videoconferencing company, saw its stock hit a new high; Z\u016bm, a ride-sharing venture, cut its work force by a third; and Zume, the robot pizza start-up, failed to raise more funding.","95":"In late March, Mary Jane Sturgis got a call from her primary-care physician\u2019s office, saying that her doctor was working from home during the Covid-19 crisis and suggesting an alternative for her scheduled checkup. Would Ms. Sturgis agree to a video appointment on Zoom?","96":"Months into collective efforts to flatten the curve, those of us lucky enough to be working remotely may be feeling overly familiar with our own homes, rooms once traveled through quite casually on our way to somewhere else and that must now function as our entire world. Inevitably, they fall short, and we start to imagine ourselves \u2014 worry-free \u2014 in different, better versions. Zoom calls and Instagram Live clips taunt us with small slivers of alternatives \u2014 intimacy has, in so many ways, been curtailed, and yet we\u2019re getting glimpses into spaces we\u2019ve never seen before. Perhaps you, too, have been distracted by the poster, stack of books or unusually colored wall behind the person on the other end of the platform and wondered about what is just out of view and what it might reveal about its owner\u2019s true essence.","97":"New Year\u2019s Eve, 1943. Lajos Stillmann is celebrating his 22nd birthday with friends in a Budapest apartment. Someone suggests paying a visit to a nearby palm reader. Stillmann goes along, reluctantly. The palm reader takes a look at his hand, then tells him she would rather not say what she\u2019s seen.","98":"Some of us may be far from family this year, but we can still celebrate Mom, wherever she is. We\u2019ve put together a collection of our favorite short documentaries for Mother\u2019s Day, by some of the best filmmakers around. Even if you\u2019re not watching together, these are films to stream with family and then jump on the phone or Zoom to ask each other: Which one moved you most?","99":"Happy weirdest Mother\u2019s Day ever to all the moms out there, especially mine, whom I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll see next (besides on Zoom, of course).

The series, starting with challah, begins Tuesday, and the recipes, along with the list of ingredients and other necessary materials, are provided to those who sign up. Next up for May 26 is a simple rhubarb tart.","105":"If there is a sign that theater is settling into a sort-of-normal, it is the emergence of hits like the Richard Nelson play \"What Do We Need to Talk About?,\" written specifically for Zoom and which the Public Theater is making available again through June 28.","106":"I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of my son\u2019s teacher lately. Not in person, of course \u2014 the lockdown means he hasn\u2019t been to school in months.

","107":"My silent reading party begins the same way every week, promptly at 6 p.m., with the now very familiar initiation of a Zoom call. A piano player\u2019s hands appear in close-up among the gallery of boxes on my screen. His set list, a mix of Eric Satie and Radiohead instrumentals, will be the only sound. Like the windows of a New York City apartment building at night, other boxes soon come to life. People are in their homes, on their couches or in bed, all with a book. A hundred, then two hundred, absorbed in their reading, muted.","108":"A 32-year-old Long Island man was arrested and charged with murder on Thursday after fatally stabbing his father more than a dozen times while he was on a Zoom video chat with about 20 people, the authorities said.","109":"On the afternoon of May 14, Joanne Patten sat down at her computer in her home in Houston and logged in to a Zoom call with her employer, WW International, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers.","110":"Strap a rocket to the underside of a plane.

The engine ignites, and the rocket and its payload zoom to space.","111":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Locked down in their homes, the four former California governors clicked into a Zoom call and one after another described how they dealt with the crises that had defined their time in office. For Pete Wilson, it was the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Gray Davis evoked the electricity disaster that drove him out in a recall election, and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown lamented the Great Recession.","112":"Last month the administration at Brooklyn College, part of the City University of New York, announced that \u2014 in anticipation of a coming budget crisis \u2014 departments must reduce their course offerings by 25 percent. This will mean firing large numbers of adjunct professors, some of whom will lose their health insurance, in the middle of a pandemic. (Mass firings have already started at other CUNY campuses, 450 to date at John Jay alone; they could happen at Brooklyn any day.) Remaining classes will then swell, which is bad for in-person education, but worse if classes remain online, as anybody who has tried to teach on Zoom can attest. The administration has said the projected savings from terminating adjuncts and ballooning classes at Brooklyn College would be $1.4 million. On the scale of New York State\u2019s budget, the system\u2019s main funding source, that\u2019s a rounding error; for our adjuncts and our students, it\u2019s a disaster. After years of being brutalized by Albany, CUNY has apparently so thoroughly internalized the backward logic of austerity that it responds to crisis by attacking itself.","113":"Quarantinis.

Easy front-door liquor delivery.","114":"During a recent session conducted over Zoom, my therapist told me I was \"glowing.\" In the middle of a pandemic.","115":"Since the pandemic forced theaters to close their doors in mid-March, there has been no shortage of noble attempts to recreate the magic of the stage on streaming platforms including Zoom, Instagram Live and YouTube (where the Broadway interview show \"Stars in the House\" streams two theater productions daily). Virtual theater productions, of course, are mediated through technology and thus not experienced as they would be from the front mezzanine, and yet they\u2019re not fully polished or always prerecorded, either. Part of the thrill of theater is its immediacy and, along with it, the potential for something to fall to pieces. That aspect remains perfectly intact, and recent performances have been felled by late starts, spotty internet and A\/V connections, missed cues and poor lighting. \"It can all feel like the local portions of the Jerry Lewis telethon,\" jokes the producer and writer Jonathan Tolins. \"As though these actors might be in their laundry rooms.\"","116":"LONDON \u2014 This Easter, James Graham, the playwright and screenwriter, was worried. His latest show, \"Quiz,\" was about to be broadcast in Britain, but the country had only recently gone into lockdown. He was concerned people might not want to watch a three-part drama on network TV, perhaps preferring to binge a Netflix series or do Zoom calls.","117":"On a recent afternoon, the nine faces of the Icelandic feminist rap collective Daughters of Reykjavik were arranged in a grid on Zoom for a group interview. One of the rappers nursed a 15-day-old baby. The band\u2019s founder stood up to show her pregnant bump. Another member sat in the home of her 82-year-old grandmother, who wandered into view now and then.","118":"I\u2019m trapped in the house with Tenzing, my 6-year-old son. I cook vegetables for him, set up Zoom classes, play Monopoly Junior. He wants to pillow fight when I\u2019m working, ride on my back when I\u2019m reading. Does he watch too much YouTube? Should we sneak into the playground? When will this end? It\u2019s a relief when his mother picks him up for her four days. But as soon as he\u2019s gone, I call her to ask how he\u2019s doing. I\u2019d rather have him driving me crazy than feel his absence in this house. \u2014 Ranjan Adiga","119":"To view Pete Davidson through a Zoom window at his home in Staten Island is to gaze into one of the most famous basements in show business. The sleek subterranean space, with its shiny modern appliances, is where Davidson has spent the last several weeks sheltering in place and where audiences have watched him, in recent at-home episodes of \"Saturday Night Live,\" perform catchy pop songs about his monotonous quarantine experience.","120":"YOURSELF AND YOURS (2020) Watch on virtual cinemas. Alcohol and love infuse \"Yourself and Yours,\" a new movie from the South Korean filmmaker Hong Sang-soo. It kicks off with a breakup: Young-soo (Kim Ju-hyuk) tells Min-jung (Lee Yoo-young), his girlfriend, to quit drinking. She quits him instead. The plot that follows involves mystery and despondency. \"Hong\u2019s formal confidence yields a movie that\u2019s very simply constructed and utterly engrossing,\" Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. He named the film a Critic\u2019s Pick. \"There are a lot of scenes done in a single shot, usually static, but when there\u2019s a zoom (his preferred camera flourish), it\u2019s unfussy and direct,\" Kenny wrote. \"He puts you in tune with the world of his sad-sack characters immediately, and their rhythm becomes the rhythm of the story.\" The film was released overseas in 2016, but is just now having its stateside debut; it\u2019s available this weekend from many virtual cinemas, including Film at Lincoln Center\u2019s.","121":"Sparks were flying between Melody Thuston and Damion Cowan even before they attended the 2018 New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks show at Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.","122":"This spring I taught a seminar (via Zoom, of course) at the University of Chicago on the art of political persuasion. We read Lincoln, Pericles, King, Orwell, Havel and Churchill, among other great practitioners of the art. We ended with a study of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, as part of a class on demagogy.","123":"Sally Love Saunders, 80, was stuck in a retirement home in San Francisco, desperate for someone to teach her to use Zoom so she could connect with people outside the building.","124":"Quarantining in your home is sort of like being marooned on a desert island. You\u2019re stuck in a confined space, cut off \u2014 Zoom calls aside \u2014 from the rest of society. You\u2019re alone or with your pod of people, looking for ways to pass the time. And once the novelty wears off, you\u2019re left with seemingly endless hours to fill with some sort of entertainment, using whatever finite resources you have on hand. A glance at the stream of sold-out offerings on Amazon and other online retailers will tell you that many people are filling that time with game nights. We asked readers what board games they would want to have in confinement, whether it\u2019s at home or on an actual desert island. Here are their top picks.","125":"Zoom, the video-chat app that leapt to fame during the coronavirus outbreak, briefly blocked the account of a Chinese human-rights leader who used the platform to organize a commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown between activists in the United States and China.","126":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The graduating cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point have lived in Covid-19 quarantine for the past two weeks, confined to their dorms, wearing masks and watching Zoom conferences on leadership as they wait for President Trump to speak at their commencement on Saturday.","127":"One of the most difficult aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it is has forced families and friends to miss out on life events. Weddings, birthdays, bat mitzvahs and everything else in between have been canceled or sent to Zoom. Last week, instead of attending a normal graduation ceremony, we drove my oldest around the track of his high school and he was handed a diploma case through a window.","128":"You\u2019re in a Zoom gathering when a young black man named Keishon pops onto your screen.","129":"Over the past couple of months you, if you have children, have probably tried to set up some home boundaries while sheltering in place. Maybe you claimed a work space in the kitchen while trying to set up Zoom school for your kids in their bedrooms. Maybe you have mined some tips online on how to make it all work smoothly. So. How has it all worked out for you?","130":"The verdict is in: Zoom can, in fact, be an effective new stage for theater.","131":"Eyebrows have been a subject of obsession for centuries. During the Tang dynasty in China, women painted their brows to resemble the wings of butterflies, and in the Middle Ages, Europeans plucked every last hair to achieve what was considered a youthful-looking bare forehead. Our arches are no less important today and indeed seem to have become newly conspicuous during the past several months, exposed above our face masks or reflected back at us during Zoom calls. \"I consider eyebrow grooming to be an art, and there are many ways of going about it,\" says Jimena Garcia, a brow sculptor and specialist at Atelier Beaut\u00e9 Chanel in New York City, who, along with many others in her field, has started offering virtual consultations for clients. But no matter how advanced your instruction, fine-tuning your brows at home requires a bit of firsthand experience \u2014 and restraint (the temptation to over-pluck is the greatest challenge, Garcia cautions). In the end, the result should be both an expression of your personal style and a shape that best complements your features, she says. Here, an expert guide to brow pruning.","132":"When Greg Glassman resigned earlier this month as chief executive of CrossFit, Inc., excoriated for comments about George Floyd\u2019s death on Twitter and in a Zoom meeting, people who have worked there were surprised that his downfall was tied to accusations of racism.","133":"The challenges of working from home are myriad. There are children to tutor, dogs to walk, shows to binge on. Hallway hellos and brainstorming at the whiteboard have given way to the stilted cadence of Zoom meetings. But three months into the work-from-home era, some best practices are emerging.","134":"Since the protests over the killing of George Floyd, the State Department has been rocked by internal debates, Zoom calls and discussions on how to tackle its lack of diversity. It is no secret that the American foreign service has long been dominated by white males.","135":"Here in New York, there are three days left in the school year. While my family limps toward the finish line \u2014 the children are taking their Zoom classes flopped on the couch, and my husband and I are exhausted by the daily meltdowns over \"realistic fiction writing\" and Popsicle-stick boats that won\u2019t float \u2014 we are even more overwhelmed by what\u2019s to come: A summer without regular professional child care or camp to occupy our 7- and 3-year-olds, while we continue to work full time.","136":"\"We don\u2019t really need \u2018going to school,\u2019\" Ella Wagar, a 10-year-old from Seattle, told her online peers during a recent Zoom session. \"What we really do need are friends. If you don\u2019t have friends, it sucks; you play alone, you eat alone.\"","137":"No spring sports. No long-awaited trips abroad or senior spirit week. Proms delayed indefinitely, and graduations switched to Zoom.","138":"School by Zoom might have been weird and compromised and unsatisfying, true. But now that it\u2019s over and summer looms menacingly ahead with nothing but question marks for parents and kids \u2014 Is camp really safe? What about a job at the local mall or movie theater? What are we supposed to doooooo all day? \u2014 books are here to help. (Books are always here to help.) For the teens and tweens in my house, distraction has come lately by way of Jonathan Waldman and Rainbow Rowell and Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan; for the parents and kids together, it\u2019s come by way of nightly read-alouds from Philip Pullman\u2019s \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy.","139":"A personal conversation between a daughter and her deceased father, who had died by suicide.

Many employees will be tethered to Zoom and Slack for the rest of their careers, their commute accomplished in seconds.","144":"LONDON \u2014 Last Monday, Adrian Vinken, the chief executive of the Theater Royal in Plymouth, England, steeled himself, then loaded up Zoom.","145":"This summer, Linda Goode Bryant, the pioneering art dealer, received the 2020 Berresford Prize from the nonprofit United States Artists, which is awarded annually to \"a cultural practitioner who has contributed significantly to the advancement, well-being and care of artists in society.\" In 1974 Bryant founded the gallery Just Above Midtown on 57th Street, which became one of New York City\u2019s first dedicated art spaces for Black artists. Bryant now runs the urban farming initiative Project EATS, based in New York. This conversation, between Bryant and Senga Nengudi, one of the artists who got her start at JAM, took place over Zoom, and touches on JAM\u2019s history and its legacy.","146":"After spending the last several months canceling, downsizing and postponing weddings, event planners remain cautiously optimistic about forging ahead now that some event restrictions are being lifted. While many couples have resorted to virtual wedding celebrations on Zoom, recently engaged couples who are planning their weddings for next year are hoping to celebrate with friends and family in person. Even as many states begin to gradually lift the restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, events of all types will have to adjust to new health and safety practices. We asked industry experts to share some of their planning recommendations for recently engaged couples who are looking to celebrate their union, without Zoom, next year.","147":"SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 On New Year\u2019s Day, North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, called for a \"frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies\u2019 sanctions.\" The strategy meant finding new sources of income, legal or illegal, and mainly from China.","148":"Yaniliz Rosario, 19, was making Snapchat playlists for a watch party for an event that some may assume teenagers don\u2019t typically get excited about \u2014 a school board meeting. High schoolers logged on, flooding the chat box on Zoom with questions, as Ms. Rosario curated song suggestions and gave them shout-outs.","149":"SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It sounds sinister. A soft-spoken cryptocurrency mogul is paying for a private network of high-definition security cameras around the city. Zoom in and you can see the finest details: the sticker on a cellphone, the make of a backpack, the color of someone\u2019s eyes.","150":"The Zoom wedding of Victor Gabriel Santiago Hernandez and Dr. Erika Alejandro Crespo Mart\u00ednez, held on June 27 in their West Harlem studio apartment, was beamed to more than 75 households across Puerto Rico and planned in less than a month. It was the result of a question each had asked the other when New York City was in lockdown and chances of catching the coronavirus seemed higher than average: Why waste time?","151":" VALUE ADDED Spend some time lurking on websites of best-selling authors and you\u2019ll be inspired by the clever ways they\u2019ve found to cheer up glum fans during the pandemic. Take Hank Green, whose novel \"A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor\" enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. He reminds you, \"Don\u2019t forget to be awesome,\" and lets you know he\u2019s discussing his book on Zoom, Crowdcast and YouTube. Ren\u00e9e Ahdieh, author of \"The Damned\" (No. 5 on the young adult list), not only offers advice (\"Persist. Always Persist\"), she also dishes about her least favorite mode of transportation (\"Alpaca. Definitely alpaca\").","152":"In early April, at the height of the pandemic lockdown, Gianpiero Petriglieri, an Italian business professor, suggested on Twitter that being forced to conduct much of our lives online was making us sick. The constant video calls and Zoom meetings were draining us because they go against our brain\u2019s need for boundaries: here versus not here. \"It\u2019s easier being in each other\u2019s presence, or in each other\u2019s absence,\" he wrote, \"than in the constant presence of each other\u2019s absence.\"","153":"You can\u2019t teach a misbehaving black bear a lesson through a Zoom conference call.","154":"Last month, the writer Bill Buford attempted to teach me, using Zoom, how to bone, stuff, tie and poach a chicken. It was something like one of those MasterClasses that everybody is watching these days, except that those run for 20 minutes, and my lesson lasted more than six hours. It may not have been the longest Zoom call in history, but I suspect it set a record for Zoom calls with a strong focus on boneless poultry.","155":"SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The meeting was about safety protocols in the time of coronavirus. There was talk of masks, sanitizers and Plexiglas barriers. But that is not what people will remember about the all-staff Zoom call at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on Tuesday, July 7.","156":"My husband, 8-year-old son and I live in a city that has become a Covid-19 hot spot. From the beginning of the pandemic, even when infections were low in our area, my son was fearful of the virus. He\u2019s a little withdrawn (though happy to play with friends on Zoom) and worries that precautions like masks and social distancing are not enough to keep us safe. The problem: My husband just tested positive for the virus, but he has no symptoms; my son and I tested negative. Should we tell our son the truth or fib and say his dad is traveling for work while he quarantines at his parents\u2019 house?","157":"First there was the Zoom boom, followed quickly by Zoom fatigue. Then everyone became a gamer, inviting visitors to their virtual islands and sending friends digital gifts. There were raves, meetings, meditations and movie nights, all of which took place on the internet.","158":"When the pandemic hit and tens of millions of American workers suddenly redeployed to their basements and living rooms, it was easy to imagine that their workdays would unfold roughly as before, with communication tools like Slack and Zoom substituting for face-to-face interactions (and maybe with slightly greater multitasking opportunities).","159":"Zoom happy hours are far less exciting now than they were in March. So is sourdough starter. A lot of the early preoccupations of our lockdown life don\u2019t quite have the same charm anymore. (Remember the night we all made lasagna together?) But the chance to speculate about the minds and proclivities of the famous by gawking at their bookshelves never gets old. So after a first foray into bookshelf sleuthing, we\u2019re back for more.","160":"One Sunday afternoon in July, around a dozen parents gathered in a backyard in Hastings-on-Hudson, a village about a half-hour north of Midtown Manhattan. Another dozen joined them via Zoom. Folding chairs had been placed at prudent distances, and masks were dutifully worn. An Australian Labradoodle belonging to the home\u2019s owners strutted among the guests.","161":"If the future of filmmaking is remote and socially distanced, a Zoom s\u00e9ance isn\u2019t such a bad place to start. Rob Savage, the director and co-writer of \"Host,\" finds a surprising amount of ingenuity in mining the horror of yet another quarantine conference call.","162":"A few Fridays ago, just before what I had come to think of as \"showtime,\" I lined my eyes, stepped into my costume, readied a prop and adjusted the lighting, which mostly meant fiddling with a bedside lamp. Then I logged into a Zoom meeting.","163":"With Zoom call fatigue setting in and boozy lunches out of the question during the coronavirus pandemic, housebound executives are finding new ways to meet and bond in video games. The goal is to break up a day that is crammed with get-togethers that generally look, sound and feel identical.","164":"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. \u2014 When his postgame Zoom interview was over, before making a triumphant exit to the team bus, Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz acknowledged that the historic play he was savoring did not go exactly as planned.","165":"Good morning. You cannot give a massage over Zoom. And that means California\u2019s decisions to declare many massage therapists as nonessential workers has made their lives especially challenging in the pandemic.","166":"\"I\u2019ve always had a deep fascination with Brazilian music,\" the Cuban-American musician Gloria Estefan said over Zoom on a recent morning from her secluded home in Florida\u2019s Vero Beach, where she\u2019s quarantined with her husband, Emilio. \"At the core, we share the deep roots of these African rhythms.\"","167":"My family and I organized a Mother\u2019s Day Zoom in May. My mother isn\u2019t much for gifts, but she lives for family together time. In the age of Covid-19, gathering around a screen with me, my dad and two brothers would have to do.","168":"A growing number of people, stuck at home and tired of staring at their own haggard faces on Zoom, are finding a fix: face and eye lifts, chin and tummy tucks and more.","169":"Kristen Meehan\u2019s home office is often a brown Adirondack chair on her front lawn, with hedges that make a halfway decent Zoom backdrop.","170":"Are Zoom happy hours still the way to \"go out,\" five months after Covid-19 locked much of the country indoors? Most nondrinkers probably wouldn\u2019t be able to say. It gets tiresome watching friends slowly sip on whiskey after their Collins glasses of sparkling water have gone empty. Eventually, nondrinkers bow out.","171":"Driven online, like so much of life, by the pandemic, the Democratic National Convention that is getting underway Monday night will not feature the customary cheers, boos and cascading balloon drops of yore \u2014 or, its organizers hope, the dropped Zoom calls of today.","172":"If you had to select the least likely play to translate to Zoom, it might well be Kristoffer Diaz\u2019s \"The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity.\" A 2010 Pulitzer Prize finalist, the play uses the outlandish world of professional wrestling, with its larger-than-life heroes and villains and reliance on ethnic stereotypes, to consider the power of storytelling itself.","173":"Pressoir.wine, an organization that holds wine events, is an extension of two wine extravaganzas \u2014 La Paul\u00e9e, a series of annual celebrations, and La F\u00eate de Champagne for Champagne tastings and dinners \u2014 founded by the sommelier Daniel Johnnes. Pressoir puts on wine trips, tastings and other events, and, with Covid-19, online Zoom wine classes with guest experts. At the end of the month, Kevin Zraly, a sommelier and teacher since 1978, will discuss the early years of his career. In advance of the talk, participants will have an opportunity to buy a bottle of Domaine Yvon Clerget Volnay Premier Cru Les Santenots 2017 he will discuss from Morrell, a wine shop.","174":"The first night of the Democratic National Convention was, to put it mildly, weird. How else can we describe one of the biggest events in American politics turned into a glorified Zoom meeting?","175":"The first night of the Democratic National Convention was, to put it mildly, weird. How else can we describe one of the biggest events in American politics turned into a glorified Zoom meeting?","176":"There were no technical snafus, dropped video feeds or any of the other on-air nightmares that had kept Democratic officials up at night. Besides a few mistimed cues here and there, the country\u2019s first virtual convention on Monday \u2014 equal parts telethon, pep rally and Zoom therapy session \u2014 made its way smoothly to TV sets around the nation.","177":"Let us consider, for a moment, the Zoom sweater. Or rather, the ideal Zoom sweater. Will it be thick and reassuring, or thin and wrappable? Pullover or cardigan? Round neck, V-neck or high-neck? These are not immaterial questions. ","178":"For the first time in the history of our democracy, the Democratic National Convention was not a gathering in person for delegates to debate their chosen primary candidates, hammer out a platform, and ultimately nominate their candidates for America\u2019s top officers. As opposed to a traditional crowded convention hall spectacle, delegates and candidates gathered online this year. From Zoom rooms, Google hangouts and other online spaces they gathered remotely from homes across the country.","179":"For anyone used to working in a traditional office, working from home has revealed just how telecommuting-unfriendly a living space can be. While it may be uncomfortable to sit in a bad office chair or type under dim overhead lighting, a bad internet connection can really impede your productivity \u2014 or even grind it to a halt. Between Zoom meetings and remote learning, coupled with more members of the household hogging up bandwidth, you might have noticed a slower-than-usual connection.","180":"A widespread outage on the video call service Zoom caused problems for students, teachers and professors around the United States on Monday morning, the first day of classes for many schools and universities that are reopening online because of the coronavirus pandemic.","181":"Jonathan Van-Tam made no attempt to sugarcoat it. Amid soccer\u2019s coronavirus hiatus, as sports leagues around the world tried to figure out a way to return to the field as a pandemic raged, Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer of Britain, had been invited to join a Zoom call with the captains of the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs.","182":"This July we hosted our first New York Times Teaching Project Summer Institute, bringing talented educators from around the country together virtually. But even as we assembled via Zoom panels, presentations and breakout sessions to create curriculum, the confusing news alerts about the 2020-21 school year just kept coming. To their immense credit, these teachers \u2014 from Los Angeles and St. Louis, Houston, Philadelphia, Miami and everywhere in between \u2014 didn\u2019t seem distracted. Instead, they rolled with the changes, continuing to come up with creative ways to reach their students, wherever and however they\u2019d be working with them.","183":"In the beginning there was Covid-19, and the tribe of the white collars rent their garments, for their workdays were a formless void, and all their rituals were gone. New routines came to replace the old, but the routines were scattered, and there was chaos around how best to exit a Zoom, onboard an intern, end a workweek.","184":"A retired teacher, a Midwestern minister and a mother of two teenagers all dial into a Zoom room. For the next 90 minutes, they do something their typical adult lives don\u2019t usually afford them a chance to do: listen to others\u2019 perspectives, and have others listen to them. And after three rounds of answering not-so-standard questions, like \"What sense of purpose guides you in your life?\", the group leaves the room, feeling deeply connected.","185":"The Martha Graham Dance Company has a long history of employing technology to catalyze creativity, enhance performances and connect with audiences. For its coming digital season, set to begin on Sept. 23, this modern dance troupe will draw heavily on its founder\u2019s 20th-century experiments with film while also making use of newer tools like Zoom.","186":"Do-it-yourself projects in the time of the coronavirus go far beyond homemade masks and Zoom knitting classes. For dozens of scientists who believe that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, experimental Covid-19 vaccines are the new frontier.","187":"Camille A. Brown can\u2019t remember the first time she danced the Electric Slide. She only remembers doing it. \"It just was,\" she said in a recent Zoom interview. \"It\u2019s the same thing with the Running Man or double Dutch.

Hundreds of them came to scream and leap and wave posters scrawled with the names of their hometowns as they vied to be caught on camera among the \"Today\" show crowd. \"People dream about coming to 30 Rockefeller Plaza,\" Hoda Kotb, the show\u2019s co-anchor, told me recently over Zoom after a show. But for the last several months, Kotb has heard the eerie sound of her own footsteps as she heads into the studio and slips behind the anchor desk, where she perches at a socially distanced remove from her co-stars and broadcasts in front of a ghostly plaza. One morning, she spied some movement outside the window \u2014 it was a nurse in scrubs, lugging a rolling suitcase \u2014 and Kotb was so hungry for a taste of audience connection, \"I literally held my phone number on a white piece of paper to the glass,\" she said. \"I was like, \u2018Call me and tell me where you\u2019re from!\u2019\"","190":"Last year, Amanda Morgan watched a production of \"My Fair Lady\" at the Sydney Opera House, drove from Queenstown to Christchurch on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, roamed through lavender fields in Provence and spent a week in Mykonos.

You might be wondering \u2014 whether you belong to a synagogue year-round or scrambled each fall to find a temporary one \u2014 how you can observe Rosh Hashana (which starts the night of Sept. 18) and Yom Kippur (the night of Sept. 27) from home.","196":"The Museum of Food and Drink is offering a rich program of hourlong Zoom talks addressing cultural and political issues. First up is \"Eating NAFTA: Food Justice, Policy, and the Cuisine of Mexico\" on Sept. 17 at 8 p.m. Led by the author Alyshia G\u00e1lvez, with a panel of experts, the event will address how more fluid trade led to greater availability of Mexican ingredients north of the border, but shortages and more industrial farming in Mexico.

Among them, the Elements Sherry Cask Single Malt, aged in kosher-sherry casks, had a brightly earthy aroma and was complex with some sweetness on the finish. The company also makes Levantine gin, fruity and somewhat sweet, with za\u2019atar added to the botanicals.","198":"Melissa Clark has a terrific new recipe in The Times this week, for a sheet-pan dinner of roast chicken, plums and red onions (above). She came up with it as a dish appropriate to Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins on Sept. 18, but it\u2019s outstanding whatever your faith or lack thereof: a sticky, bright-flavored joy that you could pair with couscous to great effect. I hope you do.","199":"\"What does it mean to be a provocateur?\" Luca Guadagnino asked over Zoom. \"We should talk about that for a moment.\"","200":"During the first few months of the pandemic pause, between Zoom readings and Instagram monologues, I often found myself pondering the question of genre: What\u2019s a play and what isn\u2019t? Usually my answer was that if it\u2019s made by theater people and I like it, it\u2019s a play. But if I\u2019m watching an actor on a small screen instead of a big stage, isn\u2019t it actually television?","201":"JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel is heading back into a nationwide lockdown for at least three weeks starting on Friday, the eve of the Jewish New Year holiday, in the clearest sign yet of the government\u2019s failure to contain the spread of the coronavirus.","202":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 On a recent Saturday morning, the chef and writer Jocelyn Ramirez faced the camera on her laptop, dug her hands into a bowl of pale, unripe jackfruit, and pulled it apart with her fingers for a rapt audience on Zoom.","203":"In the summer of 2008, Kara Young spent a month studying Thai classical theater in Thailand. \"Little did I know what the [expletive] I was getting myself into,\" the actress said in a recent Zoom conversation. \"It was like a freaking boot camp! A week into it, they go \u2018We\u2019re going to stretch you proper.\u2019 I was the first person: \u2018I volunteer! Stretch me!\u2019 \"","204":"\"Have you tasted them yet?\" Martha Stewart asked. She was standing in her kitchen in Bedford, N.Y., speaking over Zoom about her new line of CBD p\u00e2te de fruit, the pronunciation of which she sounded out as if speaking to a child.","205":"Zoom fatigue, layoffs in Slack chat, reply-all meltdowns and the general destruction of work-life boundaries: The digitized plight of the white-collar office employee, 9-to-5-ing remotely, has been documented extensively.","206":"VINNYTSIA, Ukraine \u2014 Thousands of Hasidic pilgrims who set out to celebrate the Jewish New Year at the grave in Ukraine of a revered rabbi started heading home on Friday, after being prevented from entering from Belarus due to coronavirus travel restrictions.","207":"\"A lot of my films echo what I have been through or what I was going through at the time,\" said Evan Rachel Wood, 33, over Zoom from her Los Angeles home. \"It\u2019s almost like, subconsciously, you\u2019re drawn to things you relate to, and then it becomes a really therapeutic and cathartic experience.\"","208":"When schools shuttered in March, David Miyashiro, the superintendent of the Cajon Valley Union School District, immediately started connecting with families and teachers. During hundreds of calls, Zoom meetings and socially distanced in-person gatherings, he heard desperate pleas from poor parents torn between work and home instruction, or who needed support for high-needs students.","209":"On a weekday morning in March, early into the pandemic, my 4-year-old daughter refused to join her preschool class on Zoom. Uninterested in seeing the faces of her friends and teachers, whom she had to abruptly say goodbye to only a week earlier, she instead started digging through her bin of dress-up clothes.","210":"WASHINGTON \u2014 One month into the school year, Linnet Early, a social studies teacher outside St. Louis, has an anxious new ritual: scanning the Zoom squares on her computer screen at the beginning of each class to see which of her sixth-grade students are missing. It is usually quite a few.","211":"When the coronavirus shut down clubs around the world, I found community in a queer dance party on Zoom.","212":"I first heard about Club Quarantine through the queer grapevine: For three to six hours every night of the week, a queer dance party with people from all over the world was unfolding online over Zoom. My first evening in Club Quarantine, I kept my camera off. I was anxious about having my face broadcast to hundreds of strangers on the internet. But quickly that fear was replaced with awe; I attended the party each evening and increasingly became comfortable with my camera on. Whenever I logged onto Club Quarantine, hundreds of beautiful, brightly lit boxes twinkled at me. The short film above takes you into the virtual club, a peek into strangers\u2019 private worlds.","213":"The pandemic has made it difficult to worship indoors with others, so I celebrated the Jewish New Year barefoot and on a beach.","214":"Here\u2019s the story of Milan Fashion Week as Vanessa Friedman, our fashion director, put it: Everyone is trying to figure out what comes next, not just physically, but essentially. What is the role of design in a world that is, as Jeremy Scott said on a Zoom call before his Moschino show, \"coming apart at the seams?\" Where does it go from here? Here\u2019s the answers we got in video form from Milan.","215":"Starting senior year in the middle of a pandemic has brought on more challenges than ever: Navigating college applications and maintaining my G.P.A. while dealing with Zoom burnout and no physical connection to my friends.","216":"There are many uncanny elements to life during the pandemic, though many of them (Zoom classes, FaceTime births, D.J. sets on Instagram Live) have become almost normal over the last six months. The virtual audience thing, however, is still a work in progress.","217":"It was a \"missed connection\" that could have only happened in 2020. Posted in July in a Bay Area Facebook parenting group that usually focuses more on dentist recommendations and stroller advice, it read: \"In search of the single dad who spoke at yesterday\u2019s Zoom school board meeting. You have a child going into kindergarten. You sounded kind, caring, insightful and levelheaded. I\u2019m a single woman with a sweet elementary school-aged child. Would love to meet up \u2014 masked and distanced appropriately \u2014 until we mutually agree to be part of one another\u2019s bubble.\"","218":"Tracee Ellis Ross fluffed her wig, did a little shoulder shimmy and became a Florida retiree from the 1980s. Just below her on the screen, Alfre Woodard, in a gray hairpiece of her own, threw shade and spun tales from the old country \u2014 Sicily. Afterward, the two of them talked about the census. This was \"The Golden Girls,\" reimagined for the Zoom era and aiming to galvanize the citizenry in an unparalleled political season. You don\u2019t even miss the laugh track.","219":"CHICAGO \u2014 When Chanon DiCarlo\u2019s husband and three children fell ill with the coronavirus, she nursed them herself at their home in Chicago, shuttling between upstairs bedrooms and the basement where they were kept in careful quarantine. Sometimes she administered Tylenol for pain. On the rare day they saw a doctor, it was via Zoom.","220":"The shutdown of live theater has meant a boom in short, sharp Zoom monologues. But the form goes way back, before social isolation, and some of the most celebrated examples are full-length shows. (One of them, \"Fleabag,\" went on to be adapted into an award-winning multicharacter television series.)","221":"Much of the theater made since the pandemic has been on Zoom, but surprisingly the behaviors induced by the platform itself have been underexplored. Enter Natalie Margolin\u2019s goofy, eye-opening \u2014 and hopefully not overly prescient \u2014 play \"The Party Hop.\"","222":"The plays range from old reliables (\"The Best Man\" and \"Uncle Vanya\") to new classics (\"This Is Our Youth\" and \"Time Stands Still\"). As is usually the case these days, they were recorded on Zoom and will be streamed once. But it\u2019s the starry performers who have signed on to a roster of seven play readings that promise to be especially attention-getting.","223":"In early March, Bea Kristi was holed up in the house she shares with her parents and younger brother, sick with what she\u2019s pretty sure was the coronavirus. \"I was stuck inside my bedroom with, like, no daylight,\" she said, perched on the edge of her unmade bed in that same small room in Harrow, a leafy borough northwest of central London, on a Zoom call in mid-September. \"My parents would slide food under my door. It was crazy.\"","224":"In late September, Heidi Larson, an anthropologist and the founder of the Vaccine Confidence Project in London, sat on a Zoom call with the project team for Verified, a United Nations-led group that is working to combat a rising tide of misinformation about potential vaccines for Covid-19.","225":"In the wake of complaints that \"Spotlight on Plays,\" a benefit series of Zoom readings, included work only by men, its lead producer announced on Tuesday four more planned shows, all written by women.","226":"After a derailed spring-summer season because of the coronavirus, New York Bridal Fashion Week was held Oct. 7 to 9, with fashion designers hosting virtual presentations over Zoom to showcase their new fall and winter 2021 bridal collections.","227":"The coronavirus pandemic upended Pamela Walsh\u2019s life. It shut down her office, leaving her working at home from a folding table. It forced her to turn her dining room into a Zoom classroom for her 7-year-old son. And the virus propelled a still more unlikely change: It led Ms. Walsh to run for public office.","228":"On a recent afternoon, the artists Dread Scott, Catherine Opie and Shirin Neshat, as well as T contributor Nikil Saval and Whitney Museum of American Art assistant curator Rujeko Hockley, joined me on Zoom for a conversation about protest art. I had asked each to nominate five to seven works of what they considered the most powerful or influential American protest art (that is, by an American artist or by an artist who has lived or exhibited their work in America) made anytime after World War II. We focused specifically on visual art \u2014 not songs or books \u2014 and the hope was that together, we would assemble a list of the top 25. But the question of what, precisely, constitutes protest art is a thorny one \u2014 and we kept tripping over it. Is it a slogan? A poster? Does it matter if it was in a museum, in a newspaper or out on the street? Does impact matter? Did it change what you think or believe? Must it endure? What does that mean? And what is the difference, anyway, between protest art and art that is merely political?","229":"Precisely 51 seconds elapse between pressing \"record\" on Zoom and Carlo Ancelotti asking the question that, according to those who work with him, is never far from his lips these days. \"Do you know Crosby?\" he says, leaning forward in his chair. It is very important to Carlo Ancelotti that you should know about Crosby.","230":"Finally \u2014 finally \u2014 the N.B.A. off-season is here. Sure, it\u2019s October, months removed from when the off-season would typically begin if there wasn\u2019t a pandemic. And of course, the Los Angeles Lakers are still trying to figure out if they can throw a Zoom championship parade after conquering the Walt Disney World bubble.","231":"From her home in Beaverton, Ore., Jamie Davila leads a team of eight engineers in seven states for the technology start-up Ultranauts. Like millions of other people during these work-from-home times, she relies on popular communication tools like Zoom and Slack.","232":"The antiracism activist fled on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2018 with his wife and toddler, seeking refuge in Norway, which has long welcomed political refugees from desperate corners of the world.","233":"At the beginning, back in March, the surrealness of daily life was enough to distract from the loneliness. Working from home involuntarily, seeing my newsroom colleagues\u2019 and neighbors\u2019 faces pop up on Zoom \u2014 a medium once reserved for long-distance or international communication \u2014 felt, above all else, eerie and bizarre. \"Just wild,\" we all said to one another, with a mix of awe and anxiety.","234":"Among life\u2019s great pleasures is having your mind blown by a new act in a tiny venue. Back when we could sit elbow to elbow with strangers, one such haven for arty truffle hounds was the East Village bo\u00eete Pangea, which over the past few years has vaulted to the forefront of the alt-cabaret scene. Now Pangea is making a move online with the \"Ghost Light Series,\" and not a moment too soon \u2014 as much as play readings and star-studded concerts have been welcome, there is something to be said for the unique energy, and unpredictability, of outside-the-box Zoom performance. ","235":"This fall, as college students filter hesitantly into socially distanced classrooms or adjust their Zoom backgrounds for seminars they attend from their bedrooms, the usual debates about the aims of higher education have taken a back seat to more pressing concerns. Many colleges and universities are now fighting for survival.","236":"In March, Kimberly Brown, a meditation teacher from Jackson Heights, Queens, was writing a book and regularly consulting in person with her editor, Alice Peck. When the pandemic hit, they moved their meetings to Zoom.","237":"The pandemic has thrown religious worship into turmoil. Some congregations spent months meeting over Zoom, uncertain if in-person worship could be safe. Others struggled to keep the doors open as contributions declined. A few have closed their doors.","238":"The pandemic has forced the Culinary Historians of New York into Zoom mode for their programs. But there\u2019s an upside: Instead of a reception at which snacks relevant to the lecture are served, the recipes are sent in advance, so participants can prepare and enjoy the food during the session. Next up will be Ben Katchor, who wrote and illustrated \"The Dairy Restaurant,\" a compelling history of a segment of the nation\u2019s restaurant scene that\u2019s still around. His talk on Nov. 16 includes recipes for beet borscht and kasha varnishkes, and an interactive discussion after the lecture.","239":"Drive-through polling places. Candidates trying to sell themselves to voters on Zoom. Canvassers in masks and gloves knocking on doors and then scurrying six feet back.","240":"The Mark Morris Dance Group will celebrate its 40th anniversary with a digital season, its first since the coronavirus shutdown. Not that the company has been absent from the digital world. In May, it released four new dances by Mr. Morris, the company\u2019s artistic director, made using Zoom, and has been streaming archival material.","241":"With many campus quads resembling ghost towns and childhood bedrooms serving as lecture halls, politically active college students have moved their get-out-the-vote efforts online, hosting debate watch parties on Zoom, recruiting poll workers over Instagram and encouraging students to post their voting plans on Snapchat.","242":"About 50 people sat in front of their computers on a recent afternoon, banging on pots and pans with kitchen utensils. In a departure from common Zoom etiquette, everyone was unmuted and making as much noise as possible. What began as an attempt to find a synchronized beat quickly unraveled into clanging, joyful chaos.","243":"Gloria Kaci, the director of stadium event operations at Cal, led a Zoom meeting on Monday to organize logistics for the football team\u2019s season opener on Saturday night. She directed about 60 employees from across the athletic department.","244":"Caitlin Kiarie\u2019s 6-year-old son, Emerson, begins every day of remote learning with a class meeting over Zoom. Kiarie, a mom of three in Montclair, N.J., enjoys listening in as she nurses her newborn and helps her third-grader manage his own remote learning. But on one recent morning, the Zoom conversation took an unexpected turn: Emerson\u2019s teacher asked the class to share what they ate for dinner the night before. After every child took a turn, Kiarie heard the teacher say, \"I had turkey and vegetables for dinner last night. My husband and I are trying to eat less carbs, so we didn\u2019t eat any bread.\"","245":"Along with bread-baking, board games, gardening and Zoom, bird feeding is enjoying a pandemic uptick.","246":"As coronavirus cases surge ahead of Thanksgiving, many families and friend groups are swapping out big holiday gatherings for pandemic-friendly celebrations. Some people are planning to drop off food at relatives\u2019 houses. Others are sharing and cooking recipes so that they can enjoy the same meal together on Zoom. ","247":"A student of mine revealed that he did poorly on my (Zoom, of course) exam because he was on his phone helping his fraternity brothers. I know his cheating isn\u2019t ethical \u2014 no dilemma there \u2014 but what about my role? I can\u2019t stop cheating on Zoom, so should I do nothing? What is my responsibility in creating an environment where everyone is on the same plane for evaluation? Humberto B.","248":"MENTONE, Texas \u2014 Zoom in on the glowing red map of ever-escalating coronavirus cases in the continental United States and for months you would find a county that had been spared. It remained that way until it was the only one, from coast to coast.","249":"Over a Zoom call, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, officially announced his run for New York City mayor.","250":"Nothing this year has been normal. Weddings have happened over Zoom. Home runs have soared through empty stadiums. You are now, bizarrely, a person with a favorite mask. For eight months, the world has felt unfamiliar. Thank goodness, then, for Thanksgiving! If there\u2019s anything our collectively beleaguered psyche needs, it\u2019s a holiday embracing gratitude and mashed potatoes.","251":"Whether it was the sound of kids in your Zoom calls, the way masks muffled voices or the quiet of stadiums that were once filled with fans, we want to hear what the world around you sounded like. Please fill out the form below, and we may contact you if we\u2019d like to ask you more questions.","252":"This Thanksgiving, whether you\u2019re hosting guests or sharing a meal via Zoom, it\u2019s worth the effort to dress up your table to make the day feel different, special even. Fall leaves are an obvious and lovely decorative element but if yours have withered or blown away, create a few leaves of your own from accordion-folded paper.","253":"Ya\u2019ara Keydar, a fashion historian, will discuss aprons and their cultural significance through the ages in this virtual program held on Zoom. The Jewish Food Society, which preserves and promotes Jewish food heritage, will also sell aprons on its website.","254":"GPT-3, the latest incarnation of artificially intelligent natural-language systems, knows how to write \u2014 and write and write and write. For a taste of what it can (and cannot) do, here are three examples of its verbosity.","255":"This summer, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco called OpenAI unveiled a technology several months in the making. This new system, GPT-3, had spent those months learning the ins and outs of natural language by analyzing thousands of digital books, the length and breadth of Wikipedia, and nearly a trillion words posted to blogs, social media and the rest of the internet.","256":"Normally, the 14-room Tierra Magnifica resort in Nosara, Costa Rica, doesn\u2019t participate in Black Friday sales as it never had trouble filling its few rooms. But this year is different. While Christmas and New Year\u2019s bookings are strong, periods before and after are weak, inspiring the 25-percent-off sale on Nov. 27 through Dec. 6, with rooms from $274, and 50 percent off spa services.","257":"For fashion insiders, this week\u2019s most essential online viewing wasn\u2019t a virtual runway show, or a Zoom chat about costume choices for the next season of \"The Crown.\"","258":"At the end of September, the Centers for Disease Control posted a list of recommendations for how Americans can safely celebrate Thanksgiving this year. Eat all the pie you want (but only with your immediate family). Attend parades and big games (but only on TV). Shop till you drop (from the couch). Skip the flight back home (Zoom with your relatives instead). Give thanks (while maintaining social distance).","259":"Nilay Patel misses laughing at headline ideas and goofing around in the hallways of the Lower Manhattan offices of The Verge, the tech-news site he leads. Any other year, he and his staff would be buzzing around, having a field day with all of the big device launches that usually coincide with the holiday shopping season. Instead, they are comparing notes remotely, via Zoom and Slack.","260":"In 2020, there have been more people than ever introduced to poetry via Zoom, remote communications and virtual meetings \u2014 people chose to shine light into isolation. You can\u2019t hold back light. Workshops, gatherings, readings flourish online. Poetry is spirit and can\u2019t be stopped by calamity. We\u2019re grateful that poetry has come down off Mount Olympus, and 2021 will start with many more courageous, eager to write \u2014 to discover who they are, and to discover their antecedents. Everybody has a story. We learned that this year and, thankfully, next year we\u2019re going to expand on it.","261":"As any parent overseeing homeschool knows: Zoom P.E. is hardly a hard-driving Peloton class. It\u2019s more like your kid lying on the floor of the living room doing halfhearted leg-lifts by the light of her laptop.","262":"\"Are you making a kissy face, Max?\" Shereen Ahmed is blushing as she leans into her Zoom window to ask a question of her co-star, Max von Essen.","263":"My aunt died from Covid complications two weeks ago. This is my first time grieving a family member, and she\u2019s really present in my mind. I\u2019m not sure whether or how to bring this up with acquaintances and co-workers. I respond honestly if someone asks me a direct question about my family. But even casual questions \u2014 like \"What did you do this weekend?\" \u2014 make me think of my aunt. (I went to a Zoom funeral.) I don\u2019t want to make things awkward for others, and I definitely don\u2019t want to cry in front of my neighbors. But it feels wrong not to say the thing at the top of my mind. What\u2019s the best way to handle this?","264":"The coronavirus pandemic has given new meaning to being home for the holidays this year. Most newlyweds will have to celebrate their first Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah or New Year\u2019s Eve in more intimate settings because of social-distancing requirements, but they can still do it in style.","265":"It was a tough fall semester for many American colleges and universities, with declining enrollment, canceled classes and sporting events, widespread Zoom fatigue and enough coronavirus-infected students nationwide to fill three and a half Rose Bowls.","266":"On a November afternoon, seven young students twirled, hopped and lifted their chests to the sky, as Waltz of the Snowflakes from \"The Nutcracker\" played through their computer speakers. Gathered for a weekly Zoom class, they had arrived at a part of the lesson that one of their teachers, Jenny Seham, called \"freestyle snow dancing\": a moment to channel, through improvised movement, the wonder of Tchaikovsky\u2019s music and the freedom of swirling snow.","267":"After turning his high-stakes bout with Danny Garcia into a 12-round boxing clinic, Errol Spence Jr., the undefeated welterweight, held a news conference that included reporters gathered at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and others tuning in via Zoom.","268":"The influenza pandemic of 1918-19, in which millions of Americans were sickened and 675,000 died, seemed to roll across the United States in waves, much like the coronavirus today. The winter holidays in 1918 were marked by grievous loss, and came during a relative lull after the deadliest wave, in the fall. Another, smaller surge would peak shortly after New Year\u2019s Day.","269":"NASHVILLE \u2014 Once upon a time, not all that long ago, the word \"Zoom\" meant nothing more to me than the name of an old kids\u2019 show on public television or the punchline of a commercial for fast cars. \"Google Hangouts\" sounded like something only teenagers needed to know about, and \"Microsoft Teams,\" if I had to guess, was some kind of technical support department requiring an hour on hold to reach.","270":"I gave Frederick Wiseman a call on the morning of Election Day. It was 3 in the afternoon his time, in Paris, where he keeps a small apartment at Les R\u00e9collets, a Franciscan friary built in 1603 and converted four centuries later into housing for visiting artists and scholars. Wiseman\u2019s home \u2014 and wife, Zipporah, and production company, also named Zipporah \u2014 all remain in Cambridge, Mass. But he has found Paris, a city he has been enamored of since the 1950s, when he enrolled in law classes at the Sorbonne to secure an early Army discharge, amenable to his creative process, and he has edited several of his films there. In mid-March, he finished the sound mix for \"City Hall,\" his 45th feature, just as Emmanuel Macron announced a national lockdown. As fall arrived, with his new four-and-a-half-hour documentary opening at largely virtual film festivals (Venice, New York, Toronto) to rapturous reviews, Wiseman, who in a normal year would have walked one or more of the red carpets, remained sidelined in France, thousands of miles from his family and unable to begin his next project. It was the first time in 55 years he hadn\u2019t been working on a film, Wiseman told me. When I asked how he\u2019d been holding up, he noted flatly, \"Well, in addition to being scared, I\u2019m bored.\" His doctors had advised him not to fly, \"primarily,\" he said, \"because I\u2019m of the age Covid likes.\" Wiseman will celebrate his 91st birthday on New Year\u2019s Day.","271":"Until Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s fateful appointment with Zoom on Oct. 15, his quarantine was going better than most people\u2019s.","272":"The comedy boom finally busted. Not only did the pandemic shut down comedy institutions, but New York clubs like Dangerfield\u2019s, which was half a century old, and the stalwart The Creek & the Cave closed for good, as did the city\u2019s branches of the improv powerhouse, the Upright Citizens Brigade. At the same time, comedians adjusted to the new abnormal, transitioning to Zoom and Instagram Live, and to shows in parks and on rooftops. It was a period of experimentation and stagnancy, contraction and accessibility, despair and occasional joy. In a low year, here were the highlights:","273":"Like so many things this year, holiday get-togethers \u2014 perhaps attended on Zoom, possibly in leggings hidden from the computer screen \u2014 don\u2019t look all that much like a traditional seasonal gathering.","274":"Around this time in a normal year, Decheng Sun would be preparing to fly to China to see his parents after wrapping up another semester at the University of Sydney. He would celebrate the Lunar New Year there, cooking up a huge festive meal with his family and watching fireworks with his relatives before returning to Australia to continue his studies.","275":"The Zoom cocktail party is back, so throw that shimmery blouse over your sweatpants, pour a glass of spiked eggnog and find a spot with reasonable lighting, because you\u2019re about to spend the holidays with your friends and family on mute.","276":"Mr. Jin is accused of engaging in a conspiracy to censor Zoom users in the United States.","277":"In a novel case, federal prosecutors on Friday brought criminal charges against an executive at Zoom, the videoconferencing company, accusing him of engaging in a conspiracy to disrupt and censor video meetings commemorating one of the most politically sensitive events in China.","278":"More than a million doses of untested Covid-19 vaccines have so far been administered in China to people most at risk of contracting the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, weeks before a travel rush begins ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.","279":"It\u2019s been tough to watch movies in 2020 and not project our frustrations and anxieties onto the screen. Maybe the extravagant wedding sequence in \"The Godfather\" suddenly felt garish compared to all of this year\u2019s Zoom \"I Dos.\" Or maybe you put on \"Elf\" to pass some quarantine time, and the crowded mall scenes launched you into a cold sweat, because everyone is inside and no one is wearing a mask.","280":"Helpful, funny, personal and typically self-deprecating, the voice of Alex Guarnaschelli, the chef, restaurateur and television cooking personality, is unmistakable throughout her new book, \"Cook With Me.\" There are many great recipes that should have a place on your table. Something for New Year\u2019s? Go no further than her deviled eggs soaked in borscht (not necessarily homemade) to color them purple with whipped cream \u2014 whipped cream! \u2014 to fluff the filling. Or broil and flame some provolone for delicious fun (it works). And don\u2019t forget dumplings without wrappers, cauliflower steaks, mixed mushrooms or salmon and kale on a sheet pan, a salad of rescued vegetable tops and mulled white wine.","281":"If you were looking for a single week that captured the story of pop music this year \u2014 or maybe hit-making in the streaming era writ large \u2014 zoom in on April 26, 2020.","282":"While there won\u2019t be an in-house audience for the Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s New Year\u2019s Concert this time around, classical music lovers across the globe will still be able to experience it \u2014 and applaud the musicians \u2014 together.","283":"In the Zoom era, the room behind you can really tell a story, and so it goes with George Clooney. On a recent video call to talk about his new Netflix movie, \"The Midnight Sky,\" Clooney gestured to the living room shelves behind him, which had been hastily stocked with books and booze.","284":"Even if your New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations are smaller this year, you\u2019ll still need festive supplies. Here\u2019s how to make your own party blower.","285":"As they planned their Zoom wedding, one young couple went on the hunt for a Manhattan home that was nice \u2014 but not too nice \u2014 in a convenient location with some outdoor space. Here\u2019s where they landed.","286":"In 2020, wild fluctuations in the stock market caused by the pandemic turned millions of people into opportunistic investors. After stocks plunged in March, experienced traders and Nasdaq novices poured their dollars into buzzy tech companies like Tesla and Zoom, as well as businesses bludgeoned by Covid restrictions, including airlines, restaurants and cruises.","287":"At their best, good video calls are a mediocre substitute for real interaction. And when they\u2019re bad? They can be really bad. If your Thanksgiving family Zoom devolved into melting down toddlers and bored teenagers, maybe it\u2019s time to consider adding a little friendly competition to the mix.","288":"Around the world, New Year\u2019s Eve is going to look very different this year, but the applause and cheers at midnight might have a level of catharsis not seen for awhile. People will certainly be celebrating 2020\u2019s passing.","289":"Along with so many things, the pandemic has dashed many of  go-to New Year\u2019s traditions \u2014 no raging clubs, no in-person ball drop, no kissing strangers at midnight, not even the annual party that you begrudgingly went to year after year.","290":"[Follow our New Year\u2019s Eve live coverage","291":"With bubble-enclosed Santas and Zoom-enhanced family gatherings, much of the United States played it safe over Christmas while the coronavirus rampaged across the country.","292":"MONDAY PUZZLE \u2014 The dynamic duo of Andrea Carla Michaels (a.k.a. ACME) and Alan Massengill eases us into the slow and lazy week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day, a time when you might toss aside your Zoom meeting blazer to lounge around the home office, catching up on crosswords.

None of my last 20 or so New Year\u2019s Eve dinners ever ended with a layer cake that involved molasses and cream cheese. But then, those dinners were in Paris. And for almost all of them, I cooked for more people than I could comfortably squeeze around our table \u2014 one year I had to buy 20 folding chairs and set up dishes on every flat surface in the apartment. No matter how many we were, I always had to use every outdoor ledge, sill and flower box to hold wine.

Instead, they are going to the movies \u2014 and powering a blowout resurgence at the box office.","362":"Tomorrow afternoon, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover will hopefully come to rest beneath a butterscotch sky on Mars. I\u2019ll watch the landing unfold on a livestream through Zoom, while the world outside is encased in ice, the trees like pieces of crystal.

Having to start a job search via Zoom during a year that has been challenging in so many ways is really tough, and there\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it.

Days later, a gut renovation began in the apartment above mine, inundating me with noise all day long. As a high school teacher, I\u2019ve had to leave the apartment to teach my Zoom classes elsewhere. My landlord won\u2019t tell me when the work will be done, and today the contractor told me the demo has caused a leak in my ceiling. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. Please help.","373":"Recently, a wizard, a druid, a cleric, a ranger, an artificer and a couple of bards met on Zoom. The bards fought. The druid baked cookies. The cleric, wearing nifty resin dragon horns, took hallucinogenic mushrooms. Together they explored candy-coated barracks, searching for an elusive queen; cat jokes crowded the chat.","374":"Running for mayor of New York City once involved, well, some running \u2014 from shaking hands on the Staten Island Ferry to schmoozing with donors at fund-raisers and awkwardly dancing in parades across the five boroughs. This year, the candidates have spent a lot of their time on Zoom. It\u2019s been weird.","375":"LONDON \u2014 I\u2019ll say this for the pandemic: It\u2019s brought acting talent together \u2014 and into your living room \u2014 in ways that might not have seemed possible previously. That sense was probably shared by many on a Sunday night in November when Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Maggie Smith and Judi Dench participated in a Zoom event titled \"One Knight Only,\" which was facilitated by another, younger member of Britain\u2019s acting nobility, Kenneth Branagh.","376":"Another trip around the sun during Covid means another year of Zoom Seders. Whether virtual or in-person, a good Seder service can take a few hours with only ceremonial nibbles like matzo, haroseth, parsley and \u2014 get excited \u2014 a hard-boiled egg dipped in salt water. Hunger builds, but at least there\u2019s wine.","377":"It\u2019s pandemic awards-show season, which, thus far, has meant a lot of technological glitches and acceptance speeches given from the couch.

That party was supposed to have been a guerrilla fund-raiser for Legal Aid, but it quickly got out of hand. Hundreds came, and after the second time the police showed up, the event was shut down. Footage of the rave spread to social media, and the beating he took in the press still stung.","383":"Good morning. Nowruz, the Persian New Year, is tomorrow, and, if the feasting and exchanging of presents will be muted this year because of the pandemic, we\u2019ve still got loads of recipes appropriate to the holiday. Take a look at Samin Nosrat\u2019s khoresh-e fesenjoon, for instance, a Persian chicken stew with pomegranate molasses and walnuts (above). You could serve that with salad-e shirazi, a salad of cucumber, tomatoes and onion. That would be a very nice meal. (And it would yield tremendous leftovers, too.)","384":"Persian New Year, or Nowruz, is celebrated with meals full of freshness and comfort. Here are some standout options.","385":"The Persian New Year, on the vernal equinox, lasts for 13 days. The kickoff, Nowruz (New Day), was Saturday, and though the feast for that gets lots of fanfare, the holiday concludes with Sizdeh Beder (Nature Day), April 2. That day\u2019s dishes might include ash reshteh, a thick soup of beans, noodles and herbs; marinated chicken kebabs; lamb with rice; salads; and a yogurt, mint and rose water drink, dogh abali. Nasrin Rejali, who emigrated from Iran and in 2016 moved to New York, where she cooked for the Eat Offbeat catering organization, now has her own company, Nasrin\u2019s Kitchen, with a commissary in Queens. She\u2019s selling a complete Sizdeh Beder dinner for two, to go. It\u2019s well-prepared, though those unfamiliar with the dishes might need more precise instructions for reheating and assembling.","386":"Look out, Zoom shirt. Here comes the vaccine top.","387":"Complaints of \"Zoom fatigue\" have emerged across industries and classrooms in the past year, as people confined to working from home faced schedules packed with virtual meetings and often followed up by long video catch-ups with friends, reports Anna Schaverien of The New York Times.","388":"It\u2019s not like 2020 was a year without friends. We raised a toast on Zoom birthday parties, organized trivia nights on Google Meet and spent more time than ever waiting in lines, a great place to make new friends.","389":"Look out, Zoom shirt. Here comes the vaccine top.","390":"If 2020 was the year of the Zoom wedding, 2021 promises to be a year of after-parties.","391":"Every two weeks, Sylvia Obell and Deanii Scott get on Zoom from opposite coasts to record their podcast, \"Okay, Now Listen,\" which is produced by Netflix.","392":"When the world went into lockdown five months after I started taking testosterone, I thought it would be easier not to see people for a while. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t hear my voice go scratchy or see up close the hormonal acne splattered across my face. Alone in my apartment, I imagined that all my difficulties in being seen and recognized as transgender-nonbinary would evaporate. No one would gender me except myself; my pronouns would be right there in the text box on my Zoom screen.","393":"At this point in the pandemic, it feels that we have, all, collectively, hit a wall. Last week, The New York Times asked readers to tell us about work burnout they\u2019re experiencing \u2014 nearly 700 people responded in two days. The responses were funny, vulnerable and indicative of a universal sense of: \"We\u2019ve had enough.\" The collective picture they painted was of a work force struggling to do tasks that were once easy, people who know they are lucky to have a job but dream of quitting, and who would do anything to never have a Zoom meeting again.","394":"With less than three months before Primary Day in New York City, most of the Democratic candidates for mayor appear to be quickly tiring of two things: mayoral forums on Zoom, and Andrew Yang\u2019s presumptive role as front-runner.","395":"Last summer, when Covid-19 vaccines were in development, friends on text threads and Zoom calls asked if I\u2019d get one. My response was always the same: Sure, I\u2019ll be right in line \u2014 after 100 million of y\u2019all go first. I told them I\u2019d seen too many zombie movies. But my hesitancy was actually grounded in a less cinematic reality: I just don\u2019t trust America enough.","396":"Get-togethers are being planned without Zoom links. Restaurant diners are venturing back inside. As the vaccine rollout continues to gain speed, more companies are reopening their offices. We\u2019re officially heading into new times. From a wardrobe perspective, these developments have generally meant one thing: putting on non-stretchy pants again.","397":"Many, perhaps most, of us have spent this past year struggling to find ways to mourn the losses, weather the stresses and revive the pleasures stolen by the Covid-19 pandemic. We\u2019ve monitored Zoom funerals, weddings, graduations, christenings, bar and bat mitzvahs, alternately laughing and weeping at inanimate screens as we tried to make sense of a world turned upside down.","398":"In Japan honoring sakura, cherry blossoms, is perennial in spring. For the occasion, the Japan Society has organized a virtual celebration with a Zoom class about sakura-themed sake cocktails, including Cherry Blossom Fizz, Sakura Highball and Ichigo Cocktail (ichigo means strawberry). Participants will receive the link in advance, with recipes, lists of ingredients and equipment, and recommended food pairings. The cocktails will be demonstrated by Chris Johnson, a sake expert, and Warren Hode, a mixologist.","399":"The symposium in ancient Greece was a formal postprandial drinking party for men, during which topics of interest were discussed as tongues were loosened. Plato has famously documented it. In its series, \"Archaeology Abridged,\" the Archaeological Institute of America is offering a Zoom lecture by Kathleen Lynch, a professor of classics at the University of Cincinnati, to explain the symposium and the influence of drinking on ancient pottery shapes.","400":"When England began its first lockdown about a year ago, a production of \"Coriolanus\" at the Crucible in Sheffield locked down, too. Suddenly at liberty, the actress Alex Young hung up her Junius Brutus costume and returned to London. She panicked, she grieved and then on March 18, she opened Twitter. \"Who\u2019d be up for a Zoom\/Skype play reading group?\" she wrote. \"Like a book group but we chose a script each time.\"","401":"Earlier this week I crouched on my living room floor, laptop open before me, in the small space that for the past year has contained so much of my physical activity: YouTube yoga, Zoom Pilates, Instagram Live dance classes. This time, I was watching an instructional video for dancing in a much larger area \u2014 the 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall at the Park Avenue Armory \u2014 alongside other people.","402":"As a teen in 1990s Kingston, Jamaica, the fashion designer Rachel Scott was acutely aware of the tension between the decorum dictated by her Jesuit high school, where skirt lengths were checked on a regular basis, and the liberating dancehall scene she was swept up into at night. \"There was this idea of being proper and having to present a certain way in the daytime \u2014 it was ridiculous,\" says Scott, 37, speaking over Zoom from the lush green garden of her family\u2019s house in Kingston, where she is visiting. But the soundtrack of her adolescence \u2014 the hip-swaying hits of local artists like Lady Saw, Shabba Ranks and Chaka Demus & Pliers that she heard at parties \u2014 left the more lasting impression. \"Dancehall will forever be influential to me,\" she says of the genre, which has roots in music of the African diaspora. \"It\u2019s like this explosion of exuberance.\"","403":"A member of Canada\u2019s House of Commons apologized on Wednesday for having taken a nude photo of one of his colleagues during a Zoom call, an episode that prompted mockery, anger and calls for an investigation after the image circulated widely on social media.","404":"The White House climate summit made history as the first digital gathering of 40 world leaders, according to Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, but demonstrated that even the world\u2019s most powerful people are not immune from the Zoom-induced glitches that have plagued remote workers throughout the pandemic.","405":"Bob Melvin shook his head and let out a raspy sigh behind the microphone at his Zoom news conference on Wednesday. Through the screen, it seemed to one reporter that Melvin, the manager of the Oakland Athletics, was having an emotional reaction to his team\u2019s 11th consecutive victory.","406":"In 1988, the Dia Art Foundation hosted one of the most momentous readings in postwar art history \u2014 the reclusive poet James Schuyler appeared before an audience for the first time in memory, occasioning a line down Mercer Street to the foundation\u2019s SoHo headquarters. One particularly lovely turn in Schuyler\u2019s poem \"Empathy and New Year\" elicited a hum of admiration from the crowd: \"Not knowing a name for something proves nothing.\"","407":"Allie Fox, the escapee from society at the heart of \"The Mosquito Coast,\" is no fan of any technology he didn\u2019t invent. So it\u2019s kind of a kick to talk to Paul and Justin Theroux on Zoom, a video chatting app that Allie would abhor as intrusive.","408":"HOUSTON \u2014 Voting in the 2020 election presented Zoe Douglas with a difficult choice: As a therapist meeting with patients over Zoom late into the evening, she just wasn\u2019t able to wrap up before polls closed during early voting.","409":"Ask any of the parents who have spent the last year at home with their children, while trying to participate in Zoom meetings, whether child care enables them to show up to work and perform at their best. The direct conflict between children\u2019s need to be cared for during the day and working parents\u2019 need to devote their attention to their jobs exploded into full view during the pandemic, not just for families but for their employers and co-workers. Suddenly it was everyone\u2019s problem.","410":"Laurie Woolever, a writer who was the assistant to the peripatetic writer and television personality Anthony Bourdain, has assembled an offbeat yet practical travel guide that the two of them started working on not long before he died in 2018. She soldiered on to assemble the new book, \"World Travel: An Irreverent Guide,\" based on Mr. Bourdain\u2019s writings and experiences in more than 40 countries. His observations cover the irreverent descriptor with wit to spare, hers touch on practicalities, though you\u2019d never mistake this for Fodor. To better understand it and reminisce about Mr. Bourdain there will be a Zoom discussion of the book with Ms. Woolever and The New Yorker writer Helen Rosner, held by the Museum of Food and Drink.","411":"This year has been draining for pretty much everyone connected to schools: children stuck in Zoom classes, teachers worried about their health and their students, parents juggling their jobs while managing children learning from home. And for the district leaders responsible for managing it all, the pandemic has been a uniquely exhausting experience. Now some of them have decided to call it quits.","412":"Earlier in the pandemic it was vital to see doctors over platforms like Zoom or FaceTime when in-person appointments posed risks of coronavirus exposure. Insurers were forced \u2014 often for the first time \u2014 to reimburse for all sorts of virtual medical visits and generally at the same price as in-person consultations.","413":"One spring evening, the San Antonio-based experimental musician Claire Rousay was in the driver\u2019s seat of her parked car, smoking cigarettes and sipping a well-concealed beverage, when she picked up the Zoom H5 field recorder that is never far from her reach. \"I track my whole day every day,\" Rousay says. \"If I\u2019m home, I\u2019ll have a pair of stereo microphones in my living room, and a field recorder in my bedroom. I\u2019ll probably have 18 hours of field recordings \u2026 I basically record my whole life.\"","414":"Roger Federer, the Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion, recently became an unpaid spokesman for Switzerland Tourism. In a Zoom call from his home in Switzerland\u2019s Graub\u00fcnden canton, he explained why travelers should visit his country when it reopens.","415":"Lisa Price, who launched the pioneering natural hair care line Carol\u2019s Daughter in 1993, didn\u2019t set out with the explicit goal to create products for natural hair. \"At the time I just knew what was on my head, and the people to whom I had access,\" she told me over Zoom recently from her home office in Brooklyn, her hair styled in a cascade of voluminous curls on one side and partly shaved on the other. She also knew that Black women looked mainly, at that time, to their own kitchens for hair care solutions (coconut oil to prevent breakage, ginger for scalp health) and that they needed more dedicated products than could be found on the few shelves \u2014 if any \u2014 hidden away at the back of drugstores that constituted the \"ethnic hair\" section.","416":"This is the general dilemma we are all facing, after a year working from home in leggings and Zoom shirts, or outside the bubble in P.P.E. The other evening I was actually going out to dinner with friends in a restaurant, and I spent about 30 minutes just staring into my closet as if it were a foreign territory, trying to remember what I used to wear.","417":"A Cleveland judge declared a mistrial on Tuesday in the murder trial of Tevin Biles-Thomas, the brother of the Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles, who was charged last year in the fatal shooting of three people at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2018.","418":"Streaming music was difficult in the beginning of the pandemic. Zoom delays made it tough to sync singers and accompanists, but workarounds have since appeared, sometimes involving some prerecording, that allow for theatrical flair.","419":"The films of Jia Zhangke, documentary and fictional, zoom in on the granular details of individual lives. At the same time, they are chapters in the single, unimaginably complicated story of China\u2019s transformation in the decades since the 1949 revolution. Jia, who was born in 1970, tends to dwell in the recent past, and to circle back to Shanxi, the part of northern China where he grew up, but he\u2019s also attentive to the continuities of history and geography, the connections between generations and places.","420":"RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Florencia Gonzalez Alzaga, a photographer from Buenos Aires, hatched her plan to fly to the United States for a coronavirus vaccine after the subject came up in her Zoom book club.","421":"GUERNSEY, Wyo. \u2014 It was a few days before New Year\u2019s Eve 2019, and Terri VanDam, the chief of Guernsey, Wyo.\u2019s three-person Police Department, had run out of options.","422":"Like many of his contemporaries, Eddie Wunderlich, 36, a personal trainer and hairstylist in Manhattan, spent much of the past year on FaceTime and Zoom and was not quite ready for his close-up.","423":"Last March, I booked tickets to see \"The Headlands,\" a new play by Christopher Chen. A few days later, live theater vanished like some awful magic act. I never made it to that show. But now Chen, a high-concept playwright with a vertiginous approach to dramatic structure, has created a new one, \"Communion,\" a clever and chilly digital wisp produced by the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and experienced on Zoom. To see it, as in-person performances prepare to return elsewhere, provides a dizzy kind of symmetry.","424":"Remote instruction. Virtual learning. School-by-Zoom. Whatever you want to call it, it has kept this Black man \u2014 along with my wife and 7-year-old son \u2014 safe from Covid over the last year, even if it hasn\u2019t been easy on anyone. Each day, as my son sits at his desk in our home near Washington learning about bar graphs on a laptop screen, I am comforted by the knowledge that he\u2019s not sitting in a poorly ventilated classroom at risk of getting sick.","425":"The journalist Jeffrey Toobin has resumed his role as chief legal analyst at CNN eight months after he exposed himself on a Zoom call with colleagues at The New Yorker, where he had been a longtime staff writer.","426":"PLYMOUTH, England \u2014 Call it the much-welcomed death of Zoom diplomacy.","427":"Massive parties with 10-piece bands and champagne fountains gave way to backyard microweddings and Zoom celebrations during the pandemic. But one tradition has stayed strong, and even thrived, over the last year: the wedding speech.","428":"Last May, adrift in a suddenly untethered world, five former ballerinas came together to form the 152nd Street Black Ballet Legacy. Every Tuesday afternoon, they logged onto Zoom from around the country to remember their time together performing with Dance Theater of Harlem, feeling that magical turn in early audiences from skepticism to awe.","429":"Tomas Pasiecznik lives in New Jersey with his parents, his dog and 26 other species of animals, including a reticulated python, a Chilean rose hair tarantula, a colony of Central American giant cave cockroaches and an African pygmy hedgehog named Chloe. That count does not include all the animals that Pasiecznik acquires to feed to his other animals. When we spoke on a recent afternoon, over Zoom, Pasiecznik dipped out of view for a moment and returned with two electric blue hornworms wriggling in his palm \u2014 dinner for his scorpions and tarantulas. \"They\u2019re super cool,\" he said. \"I have a hard time feeding these. I\u2019d rather just, like, watch them turn into moths and stuff.\"","430":"A New York City mayoral race that began over Zoom during the height of the pandemic came down to street campaigning in its final hours on Monday, with as many as half a million voters preparing to cast ballots when polls open on Tuesday.","431":"A campaign that began behind the pandemic-imposed safety measure of Zoom screens ended on Tuesday in a five-borough, bare-knuckled brawl as Eric Adams, a former police captain, took a sizable lead over a splintered field of Democrats in the primary race to become New York City\u2019s next mayor.","432":"A campaign that began behind the pandemic-imposed safety measure of Zoom screens ended on Tuesday in a five-borough, bare-knuckled brawl as Eric Adams, a former police captain, took a sizable lead over a splintered field of Democrats in the primary race to become New York City\u2019s next mayor.","433":"Wherever you spent the 2020-21 school year \u2014 in class, or texting while pretending to listen to Zoom lectures, or working while trying to get your children to listen to their Zoom lectures \u2014 there were distractions stealing time from your television viewing. Maybe your bandwidth extended only as far as the buzziest series \u2014 \"The Queen\u2019s Gambit\" or \"90 Day Fianc\u00e9.\" Now that summer\u2019s here, we\u2019re offering a selection of worthwhile shows that kept a lower profile this past season. From an old-fashioned network sitcom to a wacky anime sending up yakuza movies, here are 10 things to catch up on now that you have the time to binge.","434":"You\u2019re out with a few friends after a long day at the (Zoom) office. You\u2019ve been presenting a professional version of yourself for eight hours and are so relieved to speak freely at last, with as much slang and intonation and irony as you like. Then another friend joins your group and sits with perfect posture, contributing humorless and grammatically impeccable sentences to the conversation. Are you at ease? Or is this person kind of rubbing you the wrong way?","435":"Zoom and Peloton are out. Oil drillers and metal miners are in.","436":"This week, much to my embarrassment, I burst into tears during an office Zoom call. A much-loved co-worker announced she is leaving. When I tried to say a few words, I was surprised to hear my voice break, and then \u2026. cue the waterworks.","437":"In early May, a couple of weeks before she tweeted that she wouldn\u2019t appear at a required news conference at the French Open, Naomi Osaka was on a Zoom call with a writer for Racquet magazine who was trying to gain insight into the athlete\u2019s inner life.","438":"Jason Bolicki and Adam Schloff each realized that they were in love just a few months after they initially met, which was in July 2015. By New Year\u2019s Eve of that year, both had concluded that they should get married.","439":"From the moment U.S. coronavirus cases emerged in the Seattle area and then devastated New York City last spring, sweeping predictions about the future of city life followed. Density was done for. An exodus to the suburbs and small towns would ensue. Transit would become obsolete. The appeal of a yard and a home office would trump demand for bustling urban spaces. And Zoom would replace the in-person connections that give big cities their economic might.","440":"WASHINGTON \u2014 In Facebook groups, text chains and after-work Zoom calls, survivors of Covid-19 and relatives of those who died from it are organizing into a vast grass-roots lobbying force that is bumping up against the divisive politics that helped turn the pandemic into a national tragedy.","441":"Asian composers who write in Western classical musical forms, like symphonies and operas, tend to have a few things in common. Many learned European styles from an early age, and finished their studies at conservatories there or in the United States. And many later found themselves relegated to programming ghettos like Lunar New Year concerts. (One recent study found that works by Asian composers make up only about 2 percent of American orchestral performances planned for the coming season.)","442":"David Gross, an executive at a New York-based advertising agency, convened the troops over Zoom this month to deliver a message he and his fellow partners were eager to share: It was time to think about coming back to the office.","443":"\"There\u2019s a great lesson here for an actor,\u2019 Matt Damon said, a dusting of gray in his short hair and thin goatee, fine age lines around his pale blue eyes. It was early May, and he was speaking via Zoom from a sparsely appointed, sun-splashed room in a rented house in Sydney, Australia, telling a story about working with Jack Nicholson on Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2006 dirty-cops-and-criminals epic, \"The Departed.\" \"The scene was an eighth of a page,\" Damon said, arching his eyebrows devilishly and adopting Jack\u2019s insinuating vocal tones. He was recalling the older actor\u2019s talking about reworking a scene in which his character, the Boston gangster Frank Costello, is supposed to murder a man in a marsh. \"Jack looked at that scene\" \u2014 and, truly, it was almost startling how well Damon captured Nicholson\u2019s disquieting energy \u2014 \"and he goes: \u2018What I did was I made the person being executed a woman. That\u2019s sinister. Costello executes a guy in a marsh? We\u2019ve seen that kind of scene in movies before. That\u2019s not what I did.\u2019\"","444":"For many companies, September was supposed to mark a triumphant return to dormant offices, a time to crank up productivity and reboot in-person corporate cultures that have withered during 18 months of Zoom calls.","445":"Since the pandemic began, American courts have moved millions of hearings online, a development known as \"virtual justice.\" Carl Hancock Rux\u2019s elliptical \"Vs.\" adapts virtual justice as virtual theater. In this court, the crime remains unnamed and the identity of the accused a mystery. The interrogator? That would be you. Or at least, a silhouette of you, with some mild technological wizardry superimposing someone else\u2019s deep voice atop your blacked-out outline. Anyway, choose your Zoom background with care.","446":"Zoom Video Communications, the videoconferencing company whose internet app became a mainstay of American life during the coronavirus pandemic, has agreed to pay $85 million and improve its security practices to settle a lawsuit claiming it violated the privacy of its users.","447":"A few months ago, I set up a Zoom call with the architects Toshiko Mori, Annabelle Selldorf and Vincent Van Duysen; the designer Tom Dixon; the artist and set designer Es Devlin; the critic and T contributor Nikil Saval; and Tom Delavan, T\u2019s design\/interiors director, to talk about postwar architecture. Our goal was to make a list \u2014 similar to ones we\u2019ve done on influential rooms, protest art and contemporary art \u2014 of the 25 most significant buildings constructed after World War II. The word \"significant\" always inspires debate, and there was plenty of disagreement among those assembled, but we hoped to surface projects made over the last eight decades anywhere in the world, whether public or private \u2014 though we did limit our list to those that are still standing (which, if you consider various oppressive governments, imposed some geographical limitations) \u2014 and so we asked each of our panelists to nominate 10 or so entries ahead of time, from which we would mercilessly cull.","448":"We all know by now that Zoom causes fatigue, social media spreads misinformation and Google Maps is wiping out our sense of direction. We also know, of course, that Zoom allows us to cooperate across continents, that social media connects us to our families and Google Maps keeps us from being lost. A lot of technological criticism today is about weighing whether a technology is good or bad, or judging its various uses. But there\u2019s an older tradition of criticism that asks a more fundamental and nuanced question: How do these technologies change the people who use them, both for good and for bad? And what do the people who use them \u2014 all of us, in other words \u2014 actually want? Do we even know?","449":"Since the pandemic upended life last year, workdays for many of us who have been told to avoid the office have been very different. Some of it has been positive, allowing us to spend more time with our loved ones instead of commuting. Sometimes we work from our couch, or take calls from picnic blankets in the park or log into a meeting from our parents\u2019 house. Other times, remote work can feel isolating, and Zoom fatigue can leave us feeling depleted and unfulfilled.","450":"The Vocabulary Video Contest is one of our most beloved annual traditions. Working on a site devoted to the news can sometimes be grim, but running this contest has always guaranteed our staff at least a few weeks every year when judging submissions has mostly just meant cracking up at our desks. (Or, this year, on Zoom.)","451":"Beth A. Lee, a food blogger who digs deep into family recipes (her own and others\u2019), has organized some of them into \"The Essential Jewish Baking Cookbook,\" an easygoing but detailed book of sweets and savories for holidays and every day. Topping the special occasion list is Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins this year \u2014 5782 \u2014 at sundown on Sept. 6. Apples are a symbol of the holiday on the Ashkenazi table, and the book features recipes for a cake studded and topped with them and bits of ginger. A very basic challah recipe and the whole-wheat version are included without directions for shaping the bread round, instead of braided, as is customarily done for the holiday. Rather, challah rolls with apple filling make suitable stand-ins, and the dough can be used to make one large loaf. The recipe for pletzel, a Polish specialty that\u2019s also called onion board, deserves to be added to your flatbread collection. The book taps traditions, including those of Sephardic and Mizrachi cultures, in addition to Ashkenazic. It also gives details on making the recipes kosher.","452":"Raise your hand if you\u2019ve ever pulled your skin taut across your face after glancing at yourself in a mirror \u2014 or worse, in the little Zoom box \u2014 just to see what you\u2019d look like. Congratulations: You just got an at-home face-lift. For a few seconds, anyway.","453":"This summer, on a lark, I took a course on poetry geared toward Christian leaders. Twelve of us met over Zoom to read poems and discuss the intersection of our faith, vocations and poetry.","454":"Rushing to our Zoom interview from an in-person audition at the Philadanco studios, Joan Myers Brown opened the conversation by making me laugh. She asked for a reminder of what we were doing and then said, \"What an honor, you want to talk about me \u2014 only thing I usually talk about is Philadanco.\"","455":"IN THE COLLECTIVE Western imagination, Morocco is arid and desertlike, the clay-walled labyrinths of Marrakesh\u2019s medina standing in for the entire country. But Tangier, 350 miles to the city\u2019s north, at the edge of the Rif Mountains where the Atlantic meets the Mediterranean, is humid: Torrential rains fall from New Year\u2019s to Easter, and then sporadically the rest of the year. Wallpaper bubbles, paint flakes and shoes left in the back of the closet turn green with mold. In summer, plumes of fog hover over the Casbah, the city\u2019s historic walled fortress.","456":"Kathryn Gregorio joined a nonprofit foundation in Arlington, Va., in April last year, shortly after the pandemic forced many people to work from home. One year and a zillion Zoom calls later, she had still never met any of her colleagues, aside from her boss \u2014 which made it easier to quit when a new job came along.","457":"Teachers started reporting that students were in class on Zoom while, for example, moving boxes at a warehouse. The norm was that the camera be on, but especially as time went on, the kids often had it pointed at the ceiling. Teachers could tell when kids were at work because it\u2019s a higher ceiling than their bedrooms\u2019.","458":"Science has been hard at work creating plant-based and cell-cultured proteins to bring to the table. To explore this, the Museum of Food and Drink in New York has assembled a panel led by Larissa Zimberoff, the author of \"Technically Food: Inside Silicon Valley\u2019s Mission to Change What We Eat,\" to discuss the topic on Zoom. On the panel will be Michael Leonard, who has worked in research and development with mass-market brands; Patricia Bubner, whose expertise is in cell-cultured meats; and Eben Bayer, a biologist working on new, sustainable products.","459":"The good thing about a Zoom interview is that it can take place anywhere. \"I\u2019m stuck in New York parking horror,\" the tap dancer and choreographer Ayodele Casel said. \"But I\u2019m parked.\"","460":"There are dozens of completely different New Year\u2019s Days in the world. As many calendars, too: lunar, fiscal, academic, religious, civil, agrarian, Gregorian.","461":"When Peter Tinaglia, 44, and Andy Maliszewski, 52, proposed to each other in Maui in 2014, they figured they had plenty of time to figure out how and when they would get married. They could invite 20 people or 200. They could have a D.J. or a band. Zoom weddings and a looming pandemic were not on their radar.","462":"When John Casey couldn\u2019t work at Jack\u2019s Barber Shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, which closed for several months in early 2020 because of the pandemic, he created The Sustainable Journaling Project, a four-session Zoom workshop. The thrust of it? Be simple. Write every day. Mr. Casey is a shining example of the practice; he has written every day for the last seven years.","463":"Good morning. Black-eyed peas play a big role in celebrations of the calendar New Year, where they\u2019re used for good-luck stew and hoppin\u2019 John and gumbo. But as Gabrielle Hamilton points out in The New York Times Magazine this week, fresh black-eyed peas can bring fortune to this new academic year as well, along with all the other shell beans we\u2019re finding at the market in this harvest season.","464":"De Gustibus, the cooking school with classes led by chefs, has been at it successfully for more than 40 years. For the past pandemic year their virtual sessions have been popular that even now that the school is returning to in-person instruction in its kitchen at Macy\u2019s Herald Square, the company is offering a remote instruction option on Zoom. For the start of the new season the chefs on board are Jiho Kim and Kelly Nam of Joomak Banjum, with sweet and savory Korean-Chinese dishes (Sept. 23); Ayesha Nurdjaja of Shukette, with Middle Eastern fare (Oct. 5); and Christine Lau of Kimika, blending Japanese and Italian cuisines (Oct. 6). All 90-minute classes meet at 6 p.m.","465":"During the confusing early days of the pandemic in spring 2020, there were a number of attempts at forging human connection, some more regrettable than others: things like the Houseparty app, socially distanced comedy specials, nightly essential worker celebrations, not to mention the social hegemon, Zoom.","466":"Could your relationship with breakfast use some TLC? Perhaps your morning meals are forgettable at best, or you skip them entirely in favor of a big cup of coffee as you rush to clock in, get the dog to day care, ferry the kids to school or log on for that Zoom meeting. The following recipes were developed with the breakneck pace of quotidian life in mind: Put them together quickly in the morning or simply prepare them the night before, then grab, go and \u2014 most important \u2014 enjoy.","467":"Zoom\u2019s roughly $15 billion acquisition of the call center software company Five9 fell apart on Thursday evening, when the companies said they would terminate a deal that had drawn national security scrutiny.","468":"Good morning. Is this the day I convince you to roast a duck just so you can shred the meat and scatter it over saut\u00e9ed sea scallops, then serve the combination with hollandaise sauce, alongside a peppery watercress salad? I\u2019m hoping so! You don\u2019t even need to roast a whole duck. A couple of legs will do, cooked low and slow in a kind of confit situation. Shred them when they\u2019re done, make the hollandaise, the salad and then the scallops. Bang, zoom. That\u2019s a Sunday night feast.","469":"There\u2019s an irresistible temptation, in this age of scams and hype, to obsess about the man or woman at the center of a company\u2019s implosion. Theranos\u2019s Elizabeth Holmes was the subject of an HBO documentary, and is now the center of a high-profile trial. And when Ozy Media collapsed on Friday, less than a week after The New York Times reported on a series of misleading statements and actions, all eyes turned to the man at the center of the company, Carlos Watson, an ambitious dreamer who seemed to believe in what he was selling. When he spoke with me over Zoom from a California backyard on Sunday, he conceded nothing.","470":"Justin Bieber\u2019s life beyond pop stardom \u2014 namely his personal post-teen transformation \u2014 is almost completely obscured in \"Justin Bieber: Our World.\" The film opens with his supportive wife Hailey in bed with him just before he plays a New Year\u2019s Eve gig in 2020, his first full concert in three years.","471":"Temple Bar, the clandestine bar on Lafayette Street that served up martinis, mood lighting and a downtown version of uptown glamour until it closed on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2017, will reopen Thursday. And though the management may be new, it is decidedly loyal to the memory of the original.","472":"We live in the age of the reboot: an era of reimaginings, spinoffs and sequels upon sequels upon sequels. Theater, with its dependence on adaptation and revival, got there first. But this impulse now extends to new plays, too \u2014 \"A Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\" Zoom installments of the Apple Family Plays, the way that \"Pass Over\" riffs on \"Waiting for Godot.\"","473":"At first, everyone tried to make the best of a bad situation: gathering on Zoom, launching projects in the kitchen and cheering on health care workers, and ourselves, with daily quarantine clapping.","474":"WASHINGTON \u2014 At least once a week, a team of President Biden\u2019s top advisers meet on Zoom to address the nation\u2019s supply chain crisis. They discuss ways to relieve backlogs at America\u2019s ports, ramp up semiconductor production for struggling automakers and swell the ranks of truck drivers.","475":"The pandemic gave rise to a passion for sourdough among countless home bakers. But how many of them tackled the possibly more finicky salt-rising technique for bread, an American tradition that dates back to 18th century Appalachia? It\u2019s not too late to learn. A Zoom event organized by the Culinary Historians of New York and led by Jenny Bardwell, a Culinary Institute of America graduate and a scholar of salt-rising, will explore the topic. Ms. Bardwell, who wrote \"Salt-Rising Bread: Recipes and Heartfelt Stories of a Nearly Lost Appalachian Tradition\" with Susan Ray Brown, will be baking bread in her kitchen in Pennsylvania during the talk. She also plans to discuss salt-rising in other countries, including Greece.","476":"Last year because of the pandemic there was but a single virtual grand tasting for La F\u00eate du Champagne, the annual extravaganza of tastings and dinners organized by Daniel Johnnes. This year from Saturday through Nov. 14 it has a fuller docket: a mix of Zoom tastings, gala dinners and a major new event \u2014 an immersive experience, with participants surrounded by wall projections like the all-encompassing van Gogh exhibits but with Champagne bottles, not sunflowers. Given in 30-minute segments, Nov. 12 through 14 from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m., it will involve traversing several levels of display, a glass of Champagne in hand, $35, at the Lightbox (248 West 37th Street). For the rest of the schedule, the virtual Zoom sessions include two free sessions on Friday, with the rest $25 each with an option to purchase wines for tasting.","477":"Given that horror films tend to reflect our anxieties back at us, manifesting them into solid, solvable problems like zombie hordes or possessed houses, it makes sense that movie lovers have turned to the genre for comfort during the coronavirus pandemic. Filmmakers have likewise mined this moment for terrifying inspiration. Last summer Shudder released \"Host,\" a collaborative horror film made entirely over Zoom. Now \"Isolation,\" a collection of nine short horror films set all over the globe, offers stories of survival created under the limitations of quarantine. Though there are a few standout creations, the anthology is mostly muddled, privileging a heightened version of 2020 over a reality that was plenty scary on its own.","478":"During the pandemic, Twyla Tharp did what most choreographers did: She worked on Zoom. A lot. \"The whole time, I was wondering, well, when are we actually going to put bodies back into real places at real times?\" she said in a recent interview. \"And it was not possible until relatively very recently.\"","479":"As the clock runs out on 2021, New York City will ring in the new year with festivities meant to signal its post-pandemic rebirth: Once again, an untold number of hardy souls will descend on Times Square, braving the cold, the crowds and the police cordons to watch the ball drop at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve.","480":"It\u2019s Wednesday. We\u2019ll look at plans for a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square that is shaping up to be like those of the past \u2014 if you are vaccinated. We\u2019ll also look at an art collection auction that brought in far more than the presale estimates.","481":"Shares of companies like Peloton, the home fitness equipment maker, and Zoom Video, the online conference software that replaced face-to-face communications for countless schools and businesses, were darlings of the stock market for the better part of last year.","482":"The most riveting \u2014 and frequently delicious \u2014 evocation of upper-class class warfare came to us this week not via an episode of \"Succession\" but rather during a Zoom hearing, more than three hours long, of New York\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission. The matter at hand was whether the city ought to let a billionaire hedge-fund manager build a two-story glass pavilion above the top-floor apartment he owns in a 1927 building in Manhattan. But really it was about where the retaining wall ought to be erected against the desires of the magnificently wealthy to configure the world precisely to their specifications.","483":"When the pandemic hit, the choreographer Stephen Petronio found himself grappling with the confines of space, especially when creating over Zoom. That experience of restriction, he writes in \"In Absentia,\" a limited-edition book chronicling his life after the shutdown, reminded him of his early years \u2014 specifically a time in the 1980s when his studio space was his living room on St. Marks Place.","484":"Kiersten graduated from college straight into the middle of a pandemic and a precarious job market. She managed to find an entry-level job with a government contractor that allowed her to work from the safety of her home. There was no fanfare on her first day; she simply opened her laptop and began an endless series of training sessions conducted over Zoom. The sessions were helpful, Kiersten recalls, but very formal, with little room for socializing. Even among her fellow new hires, Kiersten felt at a remove. \"I just stared at their Zoom boxes and willed us to be friends,\" she told us. \"But we never had the opportunity to interact.\"","485":"MONTREAL \u2014 In June, when Rami Atallah, the chief executive of Ssense, learned that the online retailer he founded had received an investment that valued the company at $4.1 billion, he kept his cool. There were no uncorked bottles or public victory laps. His daily grind of consecutive Zoom meetings continued, unperturbed.","486":"On New Year\u2019s Eves when I was in my late 20s, I would ask my friends to reflect on our best days of the year, the times when we had the most fun, felt the most grateful or were happiest.","487":"On Friday afternoons this fall, top American news executives have dialed into a series of off-the-record Zoom meetings led by Harvard academics whose goal is to \"help newsroom leaders fight misinformation and media manipulation.\"","488":"On Dec. 11, my husband and I will fly to Paris, reviving a holiday tradition that was set aside during the pandemic. For more than two decades, we celebrated Christmas at friends\u2019 homes there, and then friends and family would come to our place nearby for New Year\u2019s Eve. Last year, away from Paris, I missed looking down our dinner table and seeing people I care about, together and joyful. I missed feeding my friends. I missed the hugs at midnight and the macarons minutes after.","489":"He was born on New Year\u2019s Day, the year 2000. I got pregnant with him when I was 19, a month before I graduated from college. I was a brain; that was my identity. I was headed to Yale Divinity School, where I would study for a master\u2019s in religion and literature. Those were my interests: religion, literature, study. I had not thought about having children or being a wife. I hadn\u2019t thought I wouldn\u2019t do those things, but if I thought about them, they existed in the vague haze of my distant future.","490":"If the 2020 holiday season was the year to cancel everything, 2021 is about figuring out how to get our groove back. Weddings and bar mitzvahs have been back on for months, and families are gathering to celebrate the holidays with grandparents, aunts and uncles. But the smaller social events with friends \u2014 the friendsgivings, cocktail parties and New Year\u2019s Eve bashes \u2014 have been slower out of the gate, as such gatherings often fall lower on the list of social priorities.","491":"The chief executive of the mortgage lender Better.com has apologized for the way he laid off about 900 employees over Zoom last week, saying that he \"blundered the execution.\"","492":"Sarah Weingartz, 18, became a makeup expert during her senior year of high school. Her days were spent in Zoom classes and at a part-time job at McDonald\u2019s, and her nights on FaceTime, where she would connect with two classmates, usually around midnight, put on a bunch of eye shadow and lipstick, wipe it off and then go to sleep.","493":"Better.com\u2019s mercurial chief executive, Vishal Garg, faced swift backlash for his decision to fire more than 900 employees on a Zoom call last week. The mortgage lender\u2019s board announced in a memo sent to staff on Friday that Mr. Garg was \"taking time off\" after the \"very regrettable events.\"","494":"Here's what the late-night hosts had to say about the Christmas tree fire in front of Fox News, and President Biden and President Putin\u2019s Zoom call.","495":"WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s now a rite of passage. Executives of the hottest technology companies fly, or more recently Zoom, from Silicon Valley to Washington, usually swapping their tech-casual for something more buttoned-up. They take oaths, explain their mission to better the world, and defend their businesses under the glare of TV cameras.","496":"On Christmas morning last year, most of the gifts under my family\u2019s tree were adorned in filmy old drugstore wrapping paper: green plaid, snowflakes, Santa Claus. So when my mom passed me a pristine white rectangular box, I got excited. It stood out from the Amazon Prime boxes in its impeccable condition, and it was heavy too. My excitement only mounted when I saw my mom\u2019s grin, which stretched to her ears. I undid the magnetic seal to discover a bottle of sparkling wine, coated in a tacky gold glitter, along with two flutes (one broken) and a confetti popper \u2014 a great gift for a New Year\u2019s Eve party I had no plans to attend.","497":"Peloton, the high-end exercise equipment maker, was one of the hottest stocks early in the coronavirus pandemic, gaining five times its value in 2020. But its struggles to hold onto all of those windfall gains \u2014 its shares are down more than 70 percent this year \u2014 show how challenging it is for stay-at-home stocks like Peloton and Zoom to adapt to the lifting of lockdowns, hybrid working setups and other habits taking shape in the third year of the pandemic.","498":"Restaurants, grocery stores and industry groups in California are suing the state to block a farm animal welfare law set to go into effect on New Year\u2019s Day that they say will destabilize the multibillion-dollar \"national pork supply chain.\"","499":"Millions of Americans are expected to travel over Christmas and New Year\u2019s, with some booking sites, such as Hopper, predicting that even international travel will approach prepandemic levels. As travelers try to decide whether to commit to their plans, many are grappling with the question: What if I test positive even though I\u2019m vaccinated, and get stuck somewhere far from home?","500":"We\u2019ve nearly made it to the end of the year, and here\u2019s hoping you will soon be gathered (safely!) with the ones you love, eating something delicious for one of the very many holidays from now to New Year\u2019s Day. In my book, this week, of all weeks, calls for a little indulgence, a culinary glow \u2014 all things creamy, lush, bubbling, tangy and bright. ","501":"For months the Joyce Theater, like most performing arts theaters, has been forced by the pandemic to curtail appearances by foreign companies. If all goes as planned that will change in the New Year. The Joyce\u2019s spring-summer season, which will run from March to August, is to include three companies traveling from as far afield as New Zealand (Black Grace, Aug. 2-7) and Australia (Sydney Dance Company, April 6-10).","502":"Do you have a special holiday outfit, whether for Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, New Year\u2019s Eve or any other occasion celebrated this month? If so, what\u2019s it like, and how does it make you feel? ","503":"If you managed to stay up late, you probably already knew: The very first moments of 2021 arrived with weird vibes. New York\u2019s traditional New Year\u2019s Eve celebration was uncharacteristically muted. No sloppy kissing crowds jammed into Times Square, no messy bar crawls through the streets.","504":"SUNDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Laura Taylor Kinnel is a math teacher and the director of studies at a Quaker boarding school in Newtown, Pa. This is her fifth Times crossword, her fourth Sunday one and her third terrifically executed rebus puzzle. According to its print introduction, this puzzle was already underway last New Year\u2019s Eve, when Ms. Kinnel had a video celebration with some friends. She presented a working version and solicited suggestions for theme entries back then, so you could say the recipe for this puzzle underwent lengthy development.","505":"New Year\u2019s Eve in Times Square is up in the air. The National Basketball Association is canceling games, as is the National Hockey League. The Rockettes are done for the Christmas season. For companies in the United States watching the headlines about the resurgent coronavirus, the news of late is unwelcome.","506":"Pozole \u2014 the Mexican stew of meaty hominy, enriched with pork or chicken and fortified with chiles, other vegetables and a rich mingle of seasonings \u2014 highlights the Christmas and New Year\u2019s tables in Mexico and the American Southwest. Masienda, the Los Angeles company that sells high-quality ingredients, cooking utensils and condiments, has assembled a pozole kit for those 2022 celebrations. (Pay for expedited shipping and they\u2019ll try to get it to you in time for Christmas.) It contains a pound of heirloom white cacahuazintle corn, just enough calcium hydroxide to nixtamalize it at home, Rancho Gordo oregano indio and ground Pasilla Mixe chile from Oaxaca. A recipe is included.","507":"Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, joyous Kwanzaa and happy New Year.","508":"Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would offer $100 to residents who get boosters at city-run sites by New Year\u2019s Eve.","509":"New York City will scale back the Times Square New Year\u2019s Eve celebration as the Omicron variant spreads, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday, the same day New York state reported its highest recorded daily coronavirus case total ever.","510":"The band Phish, which regularly plays New Year\u2019s Eve concerts at Madison Square Garden, on Thursday postponed its upcoming run of shows, including a three-set performance originally planned for New Year\u2019s Eve.","511":"As the founder of Nguyen Coffee Supply, a three-year-old business that imports and roasts Robusta beans from Vietnam (one of the top nations in coffee production and export), Sahra Nguyen is in back-to-back Zoom or phone meetings all week. And then there are the constant media appearances.","512":"And so on we roll, heads down and teeth gritted, grimly determined to reach the other side, wherever and whenever that might be found. The Premier League had planned to stage a full suite of games on Boxing Day, but as you read this sentence, its best hope is still just to get through as many of them as it can. In midweek, it will try to do it all again, and then, after ringing in the New Year, once more for good measure.","513":"On New Year\u2019s Day, Black American families around the country will sit down to eat a variation on green vegetables and cowpeas, joining in an enduring tradition meant to usher in opportunity in the year ahead.","514":"For the past 10 years, Alex Boughen made big, determined New Year\u2019s resolutions. \"It was always eating healthier, working out more, that kind of thing,\" he said.","515":"Q: I had been looking forward to throwing a New Year\u2019s Eve party after not being able to have one last year. I sent out invitations, but then Omicron began to surge in New York City. Now I don\u2019t know what to do. Is it safe to throw a party? What do I tell my guests?","516":"The start of a new year is as good a time as any to consult \"52 Shabbats,\" a cookbook that features a year of Friday night dinners. The Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashana) would be the most appropriate kickoff \u2014 that\u2019s where the book begins its seasonal chapters \u2014 but it was not published until this month, so here we are. The author explains Shabbat, kosher food and the Jewish communities around the world that inspired the recipes, many featuring the elaborate spices or spice blends that are typical of places like Ethiopia, India and Mexico. Most of the featured recipes are for main dishes (notably for chicken and pot roasts), but there are also sides, desserts, basics and menu suggestions. A chicken and vegetable tagine, fish cakes inspired by India and fritters made from leftover challah are worth keeping.","517":"After four years at 6 West 28th Street, this Japanese omakase restaurant, which was awarded one star in the 2021 Michelin Guide, has moved to a somewhat larger location. In addition to 10 seats at a lavishly decorated sushi bar, there are four tables in a lounge. The new restaurant includes a binchotan grill for the chef, Shigeyuki Tsunoda, whose tasting menu of 20 to 22 courses will cost $315. For the opening, on New Year\u2019s Eve, the partners \u2014 David Hess, Justin Hauser and Aiden Carty \u2014 plan a $950 blowout that includes cocktails, Japanese whiskies, and 20 to 22 courses paired with Champagnes including Krug, Dom Ruinart and Dom P\u00e9rignon. (Prices include service but not tax.) In the spring, an intimate spot for cocktails, Bar Noda, will be added.","518":"As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus drives infection rates to record levels in many parts of the world, major cities have scaled down or canceled New Year\u2019s Eve events for a second consecutive year.","519":"Airlines canceled more than 900 flights in and out of U.S. airports on Wednesday, a sign of continuing stress for the industry and travelers ahead of the New Year\u2019s holiday weekend.","520":"If 2020 was the year that made Zoom a verb and imbued the phrase \"online dating\" with new meaning, 2021 was its annoying younger sibling. Things were not quite as novel and scary as the darkest early days of the pandemic and initial state and local lockdowns, but the year found new and creative ways to be bad.","521":"With the annual New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square scaled back due to the spread of Omicron, and other big party plans in doubt, an at-home celebration with friends and a remote might be a more popular way to ring in 2022 than we had all imagined.","522":"The new year is often pitched as a time of hope, but the reality is that, for some, the new year might be a time of dislocation, confusion and loneliness, particularly during these challenging times. In this poem by Natasha Rao, the speaker\u2019s face is always lit up by the sun, by the light in a bathroom or by her friends. But she doesn\u2019t feel connected to this artificial happiness. Instead, she is a \"stranger to my own life.\" The last line plays on the phrase \"New Year\u2019s resolution\" and asserts that maybe not striving for anything during the new year is more than enough. Selected by Victoria Chang","523":"The Omicron variant has forced many people to alter their New Year\u2019s Eve plans at the last minute. Here are six ways to try to keep your spirits up if you\u2019re stuck at home (hopefully feeling well!)","524":"The last place that I wanted to be on Dec. 31 was church. But there I was on New Year\u2019s Eve, clustered next to a host of other Black teenagers in the back of the sanctuary for our Watch Night service. We were waiting to be freed to go to the clubs and house parties that had begun their festivities without us.","525":"When plans for in-person New Year\u2019s Eve entertainment collapse, network TV may offer as reliable a fallback as any. This year, Miley Cyrus will host NBC\u2019s New Year\u2019s coverage with the \"Saturday Night Live\" star Pete Davidson, bringing a younger, unrulier energy to a gig that has been held by Carson Daly since 2004.","526":"Every December, Jaime Ivan Salazar and his family, like many in Colombia, Ecuador and other parts of Latin America, construct an \"a\u00f1o viejo\": a human-size doll stuffed with rags, newspaper or wood scraps and styled with old clothes that is burned on New Year\u2019s Eve to symbolically cast off the old year and bring in the new.","527":"As we approach the third year of the pandemic, the coronavirus continues to make life difficult \u2014 and confusing. Official guidance on masks, testing and isolation change as new variants emerge, and a stream of case numbers turns us into armchair epidemiologists, trying to figure out how risky it is to attend a New Year\u2019s Eve party.","528":"FRIDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Wow, what a year! In so many ways, 2021 has been a banner year for the New York Times Crossword, and the highlight (for me, at least) has been the incredible number of debut constructors we saw.

Thank you for joining us as we celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve.","529":"ACROSTIC \u2014 I tried to find a way to connect today\u2019s excerpt with the occasion of the New Year and came up empty.

It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve and Omicron has put the brakes on any socially proximate revelry we may have had planned.

Amber Santos stood beside the trash bins they had carried inside the car, which reeked of food leftovers from Ten 3, a restaurant at the top of Sandia Peak near Albuquerque.","540":"It was a bad week for anyone with a flight to catch. With staff shortages partially driven by the spread of the Omicron variant, many airlines began canceling flights the day before Christmas, and the cancellations continued during the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day. The airlines shoulder some of the blame. While they had begun to fill out the ranks that were thinned early in the pandemic, they have yet to restore their prepandemic work force. Even with all the cancellations, airports were busier than they\u2019ve been since the pandemic began. But the number of people screened at airport security checkpoints around Christmas was still down 18 percent from a comparable period in 2019, according to the Transportation Security Administration.","541":"I accomplished zero percent of my New Year\u2019s resolutions last year. I\u2019m obviously no sage of discipline. But I\u2019d argue that the chief value of resolutions is not found in our success or failure at keeping them. Instead, they help us reflect on what our lives are like, what we would like them to be like and what practices might bridge the difference. There is goodness then in the very process of making resolutions. There is hope in the idea that we can change \u2014 that we can keep growing, learning and trying new things. This hope of renewal is the point of resolutions for me.","542":"It\u2019s the beginning of a New Year, a time when many people reflect on the past year and set goals for the year ahead.

Holiday travel was a mess, with the combination of the pandemic and severe weather causing thousands of flight cancellations.","548":"LONDON \u2014 By tradition, former British prime ministers are honored by Queen Elizabeth some years after leaving 10 Downing Street, so the elevation of Tony Blair to a knighthood on New Year\u2019s Day could have been a routine event.","549":"Welcome. I\u2019ve become fixated on the nook, on making it so comfortable and inviting that uninterrupted hours of reading will have no choice but to happen within it. It\u2019s less nook and more corner, a corner where an old wingback chair has been residing for two years. The chair was once part of a guest-friendly tableau, opposite the couch, the coffee table like a campfire between.

Blessedly I spent the holidays with my in-laws, who cooked just about all of our meals and also fed my children. Such luxury! As a result, I returned to regular life having completely forgotten what my young kids will eat for dinner, aside from a bottomless bowl of pasta. Meatballs? Salmon?

Still, the first street marks the southern border of the city\u2019s historic Cinque Vie neighborhood, which is built atop the even older remains of an ancient Roman settlement, and is home to a thriving network of galleries and artisan workshops. Among them, behind an inconspicuous carved wood door on Via Nerino, is the atelier of Laboratorio Paravicini, the hand-painted ceramics line that Costanza Paravicini founded in 1995, and now runs with two of her children, Benedetta and Margherita Medici Di Marignano.","563":"Just before New Year\u2019s, a 44-year-old man from an industrial city in the north of England landed at Kennedy International Airport.

It was a Thursday afternoon in early December, and by the time my five Zoom meetings were done, it was getting dark and the sky was spitting sleet. Still, I headed out the door, because my last call of the day had been with a couple of professional runners, each with multiple national championship titles in distance running under their belt. Physician Megan Roche and her husband David had encouraged me to think of my workout as recess after a long day of work, rather than another item on my to-do list.","566":"Welcome.

With so much of life transpiring through screens \u2014 Zoom calls, group texts, long articles saved to read later, Netflix series half-paid-attention-to while scrolling through Instagram \u2014 I\u2019ll find myself recalling a fact or a story, unable to identify the source of the information.

What is fact and what is fiction?","567":"Just a bit too late for New Year celebrations, astronomers have discovered that the Milky Way galaxy, our home, is, like champagne, full of bubbles.","568":"Roxane Gay was not always a fan of soup. For most of her life, the idea of \"a hot, savory liquid,\" the author says, simply didn\u2019t hold much appeal and, growing up in Omaha, she and her two younger brothers tended to avoid it. Still, on New Year\u2019s Day, their parents would always make soup joumou \u2014 a hearty, traditional Haitian dish of squash, beef, potatoes, other vegetables and herbs. It was years later that Gay, now 47, recognized the dish as a delicacy.","569":"It was another fat cable bill that finally spurred me to act.

Planning for Lunar New Year, which falls this year on Feb. 1, begins in earnest this week, at least for those who are a) celebrating and b) won\u2019t be doing so in a restaurant. Many will follow family traditions and eat what they usually do on the holiday \u2014 longevity noodles; dumplings; lumpia; steamed fish; tang yuan \u2014 cooking as much as possible in advance so that there can be a riot of dishes on the table when the moon does its thing, and to prevent chaos in the kitchen.","572":"The Lunar New Year, called Tet in Vietnam, starts on Feb. 1. As for what to prepare, you might consider thit kho trung (extra special caramelized pork) or lil banh chung (rice cakes filled with pork, mung beans and shallots) from \"The Red Boat Fish Sauce Cookbook,\" which has a chapter about the holiday. There are many more satisfying but less elaborate recipes in this book by the founder of the excellent Red Boat fish sauce company, Cuong Pham \u2014 written with a food writer and a chef \u2014 including quick Red Boat bacon; shrimp and green beans; broccolini with garlic sauce; and chicken soup with cellophane noodles. Some dishes veer away from Vietnam, like pasta marinara, to showcase the versatility of fish sauce. (Chicken wings for a party crisped with a veneer of tapioca starch could fortify during halftime.) There\u2019s also a full-dress rundown on homemade nuoc cham dipping sauces and a guide to ingredients. The story of Mr. Pham, his family and his essential condiment is woven throughout.","573":"Complex blends of teas with herbal touches shape Copenhagen Sparkling Tea, a line of organic sparkling teas with little to no alcohol from Denmark, suitable to pour with dinner. They were created five years ago by a sommelier, Jacob Kocemba, and his business partner, Bo Sten Hansen, and are just now being sold in the United States. Gron, made with green and white teas and lemongrass with nice citrus notes and good acidity, is a standout in the collection; keep it in mind as you serve those long-life noodles for the Lunar New Year. It contains five percent alcohol, as does the Rod, pink, a bit sweeter and slightly tannic from the black tea in the mix. Alcohol-free Bla \u2014 made with jasmine, white and Darjeeling teas \u2014 is more delicate. The Lyserod, also alcohol-free, is rosy and fruitier.","574":"Have you seen athletes dip into an ice bath after a hard workout?

Do either of these activities appeal to you?","575":"Many children were already asleep when New York ushered in 2022 with fireworks and confetti. On Saturday, however, they don\u2019t have to stay up for commemorations of a different stripe: virtual festivities to celebrate the Year of the Tiger, the soon-to-arrive Lunar New Year.","576":"If Jan. 1 didn\u2019t feel like quite the annual reset you were hoping for, you can celebrate now by cooking for the Lunar New Year. For this Year of the Tiger, it begins on Feb. 1, and the inaugural feast commences the night before. In China and other Asian countries that recognize the holiday, such as Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea, the festivities can last for two weeks, and the foods often symbolize promises for a better year ahead.

Surrounding them was a pileup of 50 pieces of original artwork, with several 8-foot-by-4-foot mural-like sculptures meant to approximate the pages of a giant storybook. The art was to be squeezed into the 26-foot truck they\u2019d rented to haul the lot from Detroit to New York City for an exhibition called \"Don\u2019t Sleep on Detroit.\"","582":"Parks and avenues in Beijing are lined with red Lunar New Year lanterns.

Ramin Ganeshram, the executive director of the Westport Museum for History and Culture in Connecticut, has studied the life of Mr. Posey and will discuss it at a virtual Zoom meeting of the Culinary Historians of New York. She also made it a subject of a novel, \"The General\u2019s Cook,\" but her talk will reveal new research.","587":"SEOUL \u2014 South Korea reported 49,567 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, yet another daily record notched within the past week and a jump of nearly 13,000 from the day before. The spike in cases, following the Lunar New Year holiday this month, shows no sign of slowing down as infections from the highly contagious Omicron variant spread rapidly through the country.","588":"In early January, two days after an abrupt announcement that the top editor of Slate was stepping down, the publication\u2019s staff signed into a Zoom meeting with the company\u2019s chief executive and a consultant for Graham Holdings, the publication's owner.","589":"Pauline Awino Pinnock, a chef and native of Nairobi, Kenya, has written her first cookbook, \"Africa Eats: Traditional & Ancient Foods for the Modern Kitchen,\" to be published in May. Among the recipes she covers in the book are several from East Africa: matoke, a green banana stew from Uganda; bhajia potatoes fried in chickpea flour from Kenya; and baris iskukaris, a dish of generously spiced rice from Somalia. She will discuss the book at a virtual program for Les Dames d\u2019Escoffier New York, a nonprofit organization to support women in the hospitality industry, where she is a member. There will be a demonstration of how to make fresh ginger tea; participants on Zoom who have registered in advance for the tea-making kit can prepare it during the program.","590":"The stock market has lately soured on the technology industry. Stock prices of many of the largest companies are down this year, some slightly \u2014 shares of Apple and Google have fallen more than 6 percent \u2014 and some stupendously: Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Netflix have lost about a third of their value since the New Year. Because surging tech stocks drove a big part of the stock market\u2019s rise in 2021, their decline has contributed much to the market\u2019s fall. The S & P 500 is down by about 7 percent in 2022.","591":"I remember the first time I walked up the steps to New York Fashion Week at Lincoln Center a decade ago, armed with my camera and a new zoom lens I purchased just for this occasion. I had no expectations except for the fact that a friend of mine thought it would be a nice boost to my growing love for collecting portraits of strangers on the streets.","592":"Months ago, over Zoom, I told a patient\u2019s wife that her husband was dying of Covid-19.

And the Soviets often returned the favor. Off the coast near the Russian port city of Vladivostok, helicopter pilots from U.S. Navy frigates kept an eye on the Soviet fleet in the 1980s by flying regular surveillance missions. The Americans came to expect a pattern of behavior: Usually within 20 minutes or so of their helicopter becoming airborne, Soviet MiG-27 fighter jets would zoom out for an initial visual identification of the U.S. aircraft. Two Soviet Mi-24 \"Hind\" helicopter gunships \u2014 larger than the American helicopters \u2014 would follow behind, flying alongside the Americans for about two hours.","598":"Better.com, the mortgage lending company, plans to fire more than a third of its staff this week, the company said on Tuesday, three months after its chief executive, Vishal Garg, set off an outcry by firing more than 900 employees on a Zoom call.","599":"Since 2002, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim have run their trendsetting label Opening Ceremony more like a social club than a clothing line. \"People often come to the brand through an event or a party we throw,\" says Lim from the patio of Chifa, a 1980s-inflected Chinese Peruvian restaurant, with zebra-print walls and a big heart-shaped picture window, that Leon designed with the architect Michael Loverich. It\u2019s a cool mid-February evening on the 15th and final day of Lunar New Year celebrations, and the pair\u2019s loved ones have gathered in the glow of a full moon, in the cozy, vibrant Los Angeles neighborhood of Eagle Rock, to observe the Lantern Festival, a closing ceremony of sorts that symbolizes rebirth and promotes good fortune.","600":"MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A group of middle-aged Chinese Australians logged onto Zoom to step, kick and punch through their regular exercise class one day late last month.

One game she likes to play during her laughter workshops involves asking participants to each name five items in a category \u2014 for example, things in their refrigerator \u2014 as fast as they can, after which everyone else chants: \"Those are five things!\" Eventually people loosen up. They start giggling. (Maybe you had to be there.)","606":"During the first two years of the pandemic, Kristi Falzon, who lives in Chicago, used her Peloton every day. \"It was a godsend,\" she said. She could exercise in her spare bedroom between Zoom meetings without worrying about other people\u2019s germs.","607":"In a recent conversation with a colleague, the topic of Zoom came up, and I pointed out that the advantage of socializing with friends on video is the ability to simply say goodbye and X out of the conversation \u2014 no need for lingering or superfluous pleasantries. My colleague laughed and remarked: \"Even better: Stay on a free Zoom trial! This way, it kicks you off after 40 minutes, regardless of what is happening.\"","608":"The mortgage lender Better.com announced another round of layoffs on Tuesday after cutting roughly 900 people late last year in a mass firing over Zoom that drew swift backlash.","609":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 Some of Jaishri Abichandani\u2019s artworks are so palpable, they evoke a strong sense of touch just by looking at them. The centerpieces of \"Flower-Headed Children,\" her solo exhibition at Craft Contemporary, are figures sculpted from polymer clay and decked in petals and jewelry. They appear handmade, with an attention to detail that seems as pleasureful as it is painstaking. Filled with color \u2014 including walls painted blue and gold \u2014 and traditionally beautiful materials, the show revels in visual abundance. It reminds you, in case you\u2019ve forgotten amid an endless stream of Zoom meetings, of the delights of physicality.","610":"The entire audition for \"Funny Girl,\" which comes to Broadway this month, was over Zoom. It was a very private process for me because playing Fanny Brice [the plucky real-life early 20th-century actress at the center of Jule Styne, Bob Merrill and Isobel Lennart\u2019s 1964 musical] has been my dream forever, and I thought if I mentioned to people that I was auditioning, my longing for the role would grow too much. I couldn\u2019t get my mom\u2019s hopes up like that. So I just didn\u2019t tell anybody. The only person who knew was Liz Caplan, who\u2019s been my voice teacher for nearly a decade. Beginning in September, we started working together on this show twice a week, mostly over FaceTime. My voice was really, really exhausted from filming \"Impeachment: American Crime Story,\" where I played Monica Lewinsky, so a lot of what Liz and I had to do was just rebuild it.","611":"Jillian Amodio has run out of patience for Zoom. The whole window-into-your-private-life experiment was novel in the early, chaotic days of the pandemic, when it was almost a badge of honor if your children melted down onscreen or your cat made a cameo. But those days are gone, and by now most people have invested in a ring light or, at the very least, mastered the virtual background.","612":"If you think the enjoyment of green tea is a relatively new pursuit in the United States, a Zoom talk for the Culinary Historians of New York will set you straight.

Not as a child might doodle a T. rex, but as an artist drawing a self-portrait. At 62, he was 20 years into his career as the head of the illustration and cartooning departments at the School of Visual Arts, and he\u2019d begun to worry that he and his students came from different eras. One class failed to recognize Picasso\u2019s \"Guernica\" but could name Forky, the Picasso-inspired spork character in Toy Story 4. \"It doesn\u2019t count anymore if you\u2019re a gay man of a certain age who went through the AIDS crisis,\" he says from the same drafting table in his studio, a repurposed barn in Germantown, N.Y., where for more than a year he taught via Zoom. \"It\u2019s something that\u2019s just kind of like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re a dinosaur.\u2019\"","628":"At the start of a Caveday session, gentle music plays.

And if so, how does the damage compare with other headphone styles?","633":"When I think about the earliest days of the pandemic in New York City, my memories are bittersweet. It was a stressful and scary time, of course. But there were some nice, quiet moments, too: gathering in the park, sitting exactly six feet apart. Drinks and dinner on stoops (again, six feet apart). Weekly game nights over Zoom.","634":"Blitz Bazawule\u2019s vibrant, funny thriller THE SCENT OF BURNT FLOWERS (235 pp., Ballantine, $27) begins, quite literally, with a bang. In 1966, the young, beautiful Bernadette awakes in Accra to the sound of gunfire and believes that her fianc\u00e9, Melvin, has shot himself. \"She had feared this day would come, yet nothing could prepare her for it.\" But Bernadette need not fear, yet, for the explosion that wakes her is the sound of jubilant Ghanaians celebrating the New Year. It\u2019s clever, if not especially subtle, foreshadowing of the violence that will stalk the young couple as they speed across Ghana, seeking safety in a country on the verge of a coup.","635":"WASHINGTON \u2014 If you\u2019re a well-paid lawyer eyeing an electric Rivian sport-utility vehicle, you might want to buy it before New Year\u2019s Day. If you\u2019re a middle-class nurse saving up for a compact Chevrolet Bolt, you might want to wait until January.","636":"No societal shift has impacted my adult life as profoundly as the extended closure of schools during the pandemic. At first, I mourned my career, which I gave up to facilitate the purgatory of Zoom \"school\" for my first grader. Then I mourned my family\u2019s precarious, hard-won harmony, which dissolved into endless fights about time, work and space. Finally, I mourned the faith I\u2019d held, without ever recognizing it as such, in public institutions. I discovered I no longer believed in school. I no longer believed in many of the systems I\u2019d taken for granted as mostly valuable and functional. I spun out into despair, then anger, then a flat, terrible resignation.","637":"Across almost seven hours Thursday night, the speeches grew in volume and intensity \u2014 a cacophony of New Yorkers brought together over Zoom to either praise or denounce one of the city\u2019s most contentious transportation projects.","638":"Co-workers stuck on a Zoom call, deliberating a new strategy for a crucial project. Roommates at the kitchen table, arguing about how to split utility bills fairly. Neighbors at a city meeting, debating how to pay for street repairs.","639":"The first thing, and likely the most important thing, is that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney seem to be sincere. It is hard to be absolutely certain, of course: They are both actors, after all, and a 45-minute Zoom meeting is, on balance, probably not the ideal format in which to take the measure of someone\u2019s soul.","640":"Thousands of Hasidic Jews from Israel and other countries are making their way to Uman, a city in central Ukraine, for a traditional pilgrimage over Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, defying stern travel warnings issued by the Israeli government and the pleas of Ukrainian officials who had asked them to stay away because of the war.","641":"Good morning. Rosh Hashana, the two-day celebration of the Jewish New Year, gets underway this evening: solemn prayers at synagogue followed by festive eating at home.","642":"The way Americans receive mental health care has never changed as quickly as it has since the spring of 2020. When the Covid pandemic forced so many of us into our homes and onto Zoom, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and social workers followed. What started as a short-term fix is now becoming permanent. Today, nearly 40 percent of mental health and substance use outpatient treatment visits at hospitals and clinics are offered remotely, compared with just 1 percent in 2019.","643":"\"I don\u2019t want everybody to see my face,\" the 64-year-old woman told her mother-in-law over the phone. She wanted to cancel the Zoom that had to stand in for their usual holiday get-together. It was December 2020, and thanks to Covid-19, no one was traveling. When she finally agreed to participate in the video gathering, no one mentioned the strange changes that were so obvious.","644":"Everyone knows what coming of age in America is supposed to look like. Countless movies and books have told us. Then came 2020. Instead of proms and championship games and all-night hangouts with friends, there was school on Zoom from bed.","645":"ACROSTIC \u2014 A loyal solver recently asked if acrostics have been getting harder this year. I think they may have, if you zoom out; although I still get through a puzzle smoothly, I\u2019ve been getting stumped a lot in clue sets lately, and the trend seems to be toward higher difficulty. This is subjective, of course. Every passage is going to click for some solvers and not for others, and everyone\u2019s knowledge is different. This is all a lead-up to me admitting that today\u2019s puzzle, constructed by team Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon, caught me fairly flat-footed for the longest time, to the point of feeling silly when I realized what it was all about and managed to finish.","646":"How does one write a generational narrative when the lineage of so many has been subjugated and erased? E.M. Tran tackles this question in her daring debut, \"Daughters of the New Year.\"","647":"In December 2003 I received an assignment that would change my life. I was a young reporter for The New York Times, detailed to the paper\u2019s sleepy Westchester bureau but dreaming of a career as a foreign correspondent. Haiti was scheduled to celebrate the bicentennial of its independence on New Year\u2019s Day. Was I interested in covering it, my editor asked?","648":"For the thousands of young people who started their first ever jobs during the pandemic, there was little opportunity to experience the familiar rites and rituals of early adulthood. They navigated periods of economic chaos, from the Great Resignation to soaring inflation. Some graduated on Zoom, celebrated in their childhood bedrooms and then opened their laptops again to start remote jobs.","649":"Remember all those book clubs that popped up in 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, when a lot of people wanted to deepen their understanding of racial violence? (There was one reading group comprising several hundred white women in the arts that met regularly on Zoom.) And the chorus of urgent \"we-must-do-more\" statements put out by museums to show support for the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted around the country?","650":"\"It\u2019s hard to hold someone\u2019s hand over Zoom,\" Steven Spielberg told A.O. Scott recently. He was speaking of the pandemic experience of writing his autobiographical new film, \"The Fabelmans,\" with the playwright Tony Kushner. But, despite their being on opposite coasts, Kushner was able to provide Spielberg with the supportive environment he needed to unpack intimate details of his boyhood. \"We got into those tender trenches,\" Spielberg said.","651":"One July morning, a five-person jury \u2014 including the writers Pico Iyer and Aatish Taseer, the architect Toshiko Mori, the chef and food scientist David Zilber and the landscape photographer Victoria Sambunaris \u2014 gathered over Zoom to debate what, exactly, constitutes a \"travel experience\" and how some might rise above the rest. To get the conversation started, each panelist had nominated at least 10 selections in advance of the call; their job now was to slash that list from 55 to 25.","652":"The busy holiday season is here, and before we know it, many of us will be gathering for parties, visiting relatives and ringing in the New Year with friends. (Now is a good time to stock up on at-home rapid tests and high-quality masks and to consider getting an updated booster, if you haven\u2019t already.)","653":"Social media\u2019s newest star is a robot: a program called ChatGPT that tries to answer questions like a person.","654":"Holiday albums are more than background music played in the weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Eve. They offer artists a chance to recontextualize themselves, play around in a nostalgic format, reinvent traditions and even strike gold in what\u2019s become a lucrative season for the music business. Here\u2019s a spin through 15 of the latest releases.","655":"It\u2019s writing podcast scripts, finishing students\u2019 homework and correcting mistakes in computer code: ChatGPT, the A.I. chatbot from OpenAI, is suddenly everywhere. Who should decide how it\u2019s built? What could go wrong? And what could go right?","656":"On Twitter this week, it seemed everyone was sharing communiqu\u00e9s from GPT-3, the A.I. chatbot that can answer just about any question with extraordinary facility, as long as you don\u2019t mind answers whose political assumptions are safely conditioned by a conventional libertarian-inflected liberalism.","657":"This month, Jeremy Howard, an artificial intelligence researcher, introduced an online chatbot called ChatGPT to his 7-year-old daughter. It had been released a few days earlier by OpenAI, one of the world\u2019s most ambitious A.I. labs.","658":"In the disturbing Vietnamese documentary \"Children of the Mist,\" a plucky 12-year-old girl named Di is abducted after a Lunar New Year celebration. Her parents are frustrated at best \u2014 who will feed the pigs when they go drinking? But their response is not unusual in this remote mountain region of northern Vietnam, where the Hmong \u2014 one of the country\u2019s largest ethnic groups \u2014 reside.","659":"ChatGPT makes an irresistible first impression. It\u2019s got a devastating sense of humor, a stunning capacity for dead-on mimicry, and it can rhyme like nobody\u2019s business. Then there is its overwhelming reasonableness. When ChatGPT fails the Turing test, it\u2019s usually because it refuses to offer its own opinion on just about anything. When was the last time real people on the internet declined to tell you what they really think?","660":"I type the town of Sperizh\u2019e into Google Maps. All I see is decontextualized green, so I zoom out until my screen shows a location in southeast Belarus, no more than 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border \u2014 far closer to Kyiv than Minsk. To the immediate left of Sperizh\u2019e is the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve, an enclosed territory created in 1988 to cordon off the land most affected by fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.","661":"Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, joyous Kwanzaa and happy New Year.","662":"On March 10, two weeks after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the White House convened a Zoom call with 30 prominent TikTok creators. Jen Psaki, then the White House press secretary, and members of the National Security Council staff briefed the creators, who together had tens of millions of followers, on the latest news from the conflict and the White House\u2019s goals and priorities. The meeting followed a similar effort the previous summer, in which the White House recruited dozens of TikTokers to help encourage young people to get vaccinated against Covid.","663":"Everyone in my professional life \u2014 fellow faculty members, other writers \u2014 is up in arms about ChatGPT, the new artificial intelligence tool that can write like a human being.","664":"Some people know how they\u2019re going to spend their New Year\u2019s Eve well before Dec. 31. Then there are those who wait until the last minute, fretting over where to go and whom to go with, or whether they should just stay home and conk out at 10:30 p.m. (A completely understandable and excellent choice.)","665":"I didn\u2019t grow up eating many casseroles, and the main event at my family\u2019s holiday brunch was bagels and lox. So, the first time I encountered a breakfast casserole at a New Year\u2019s Day shindig, I was dubious. Where was the Nova and whitefish salad? Or at least the coffee cake and French toast I associated with parties held before noon?","666":"I\u2019m going to close out 2022 by opening my front door and having fun in person. Unlike last New Year\u2019s Eve, New York is back in the business of live entertainment for New Year\u2019s Eve. I might have to wear a mask, but like Whitney Houston, I want to dance with somebody.","667":"To walk into Veniero\u2019s, the beloved Italian pastry shop on East 11th Street, just off First Avenue, is to step into a dreamscape of buttery cookies, cannoli and tarts heavy and trembling with jewel-colored fruit. On one side of the double-fronted building is the main cafe. On the other is the store, inside which, on long glass shelves, are the pastries \u2014\u202f including, on a mid-December visit, those made only at this time of year: Neapolitan struffoli, a little Vesuvius of golden fried dough balls glazed with honey and made merry with rainbow-colored nonpareil sprinkles and candied fruit; pignolata from Messina \u2014 more fried dough but in large irregular shapes and covered in vanilla-lemon or chocolate icing; susumelle, a soft almond biscuit flavored with honey and orange oil; and three kinds of torrone, the Sicilian nougat candy. There are also yule logs, for which Veniero\u2019s will provide, on request, and little signs that read, \"Merry Christmas,\" \"Happy New Year\" or \"Happy Hanukkah,\" because, as Robert Zerilli, the store\u2019s co-owner, along with his three siblings, and manager, says, \"This is New York. We celebrate everything! We sell delicious rugelach.\"","668":"\"Your favorite New Year\u2019s Eve ever?\" I asked my husband of 10 years. I was recalling our early-romance giddy-tipsy stroll up the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, champagne and kisses shared between us \u2014 but I was open to hearing his choice. Patrick smiled dreamily and said, \"The Rose Garden in Bern: snow falling softly around her.\" Less gently than before, I said, \"Let\u2019s try that again. What was your favorite New Year\u2019s Eve ever \u2014 not with your ex-girlfriend, but with your wife.\" \"Oops,\" he said, recognizing his error. We\u2019ll celebrate our 30th anniversary in January. (Yeah, he knows better by now.) \u2014 Margaret Ghielmetti","669":"You\u2019re no doubt familiar with the feeling of walking into a New Year\u2019s Eve party and confronting a very particular temporal melancholy: the sensation that you and everyone there are doomed to repeat such an arbitrary occasion for the rest of our lives.  ","670":"Every year, around 1 or 2 a.m. on Jan. 1, Joline O\u2019Leary drives home from a big New Year\u2019s Eve party. Before turning in for the night, after the Champagne and fireworks, she eats a bowl of tteok guk, a humble Korean soup of beef broth boiled with thinly sliced, oblong ovals of tteok, or rice cakes. O\u2019Leary, whom I met on a recent trip to Honolulu, is a fourth-generation Korean American. For her, this ritual is the first thing she likes to check off her list for the new year. \"It\u2019s good luck,\" she said, \"and I appreciate the tradition.\"","671":"Crowds will once again gather in Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve to bring in 2023, peering through more than one ton of confetti to catch a glimpse of the 11,875-pound ball made of Waterford Crystal as it descends, an annual tradition that dates back to 1907.","672":"Ukrainian officials are optimistic that rolling power outages will not be necessary around the New Year holidays as crews work to repair the country\u2019s power grid, which has been battered by Russian strikes.","673":"Today we\u2019ll look at an old New York story, a soap opera-worthy tale that bubbled up as the Metropolitan Opera prepared to revive a real opera on New Year\u2019s Eve.","674":"After two years of lockdown sweatpants and Zoom galas (remember those?), the party circuit in New York City came roaring back. Black-tie benefits went mask-free. Cultural performances held opening nights. Fashion labels hosted raves and intimate dinners. Movies and TV shows had red-carpet premieres. Gallery openings spilled out onto sidewalks.","675":"At the New Year, the list genre returns with a vengeance when people make their annual resolutions. Laynie Browne\u2019s list poem follows the usual form with its numbers and occasional imperative. Browne\u2019s list, however, is an anti-list, a list for the imagination and strangeness, asking the reader to misplace the year, to avoid the dangers of beginnings, to \"Refuse to look at detailed maps.\" In the new year, Browne\u2019s speaker isn\u2019t looking for the usual pedestrian and mundane resolutions that we name for ourselves, such as losing weight or saving money. Instead, her resolutions argue for openness, freedom from the past, the self and the known, for something unknown and magical. Selected by Victoria Chang","676":"If resolution makers wanted a patron saint, they could do worse than Samuel Johnson (1709 to 1784), a lifelong resolver and by his own admission a lifelong failure at keeping his resolutions. Reading his diaries, we may sigh in recognition as time after time \u2014 at the New Year, at Easter and on his birthday \u2014 Johnson renews his intentions to rise early, to be more studious, to be more moderate in his intake of food and drink, and laments his neglect of those same intentions in the year past.","677":"It\u2019s the last Veggie of 2022 and, as your writer, I have to admit I\u2019ve often slipped into a weird timeline in the kitchen: temporarily ahead in time, out of sync with everyone else so that I can tell you about a recipe I love and you can make it at just the right moment. This isn\u2019t a complaint! The other night, for example, I feasted on Eric Kim\u2019s chestnut risotto, a luxurious New Year\u2019s Eve dinner, even though it was just a regular-shmegular Thursday night.","678":"ACROSTIC \u2014 You might be seeing this in 2022, but happy New Year! Team Emily Cox\/Henry Rathvon wishes solvers well and recommends a little bit of \"Weird Al\" as an accompaniment to this acrostic, hopefully not in conjunction with a dose of lonely Tylenol if you get a headache.","679":"Selections from the Weekend section, including a roundup of New Year's Eve events.","680":"If the Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Concert is a global success, its legacy and reach rest on five pillars: a marvelous orchestra; internationally renowned conductors; a timeless repertoire, by the Strauss family and other composers of the 19th century; a splendid location, the gilded Musikverein; and TV broadcasts watched most recently by some 1.2 million people in 92 countries on five continents.","681":"Millions of people got on planes between Christmas and New Year\u2019s \u2014 braving bad weather, armrest hogs and an epic Southwest Airlines meltdown.","682":"The idea behind exchanging a kiss at midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve is rooted in a simple superstition: The way you ring in the new year will determine how the rest of your year will go.","683":"Since October, Rashad Hayes, a D.J. from Brooklyn who prides himself on spinning, in his words, \"every genre,\" has fielded 12 offers to work on New Year\u2019s Eve in New York City \u2014 triple what he was offered in 2019. So he did what any other enterprising artist who is suddenly in demand after surviving two years of Covid slowdowns and cancellations (and willing to work on New Year\u2019s Eve) might do: He packed three sets in, at three different venues in Manhattan.","684":"One of my favorite New Year\u2019s traditions is writing resolutions for other people. Tonight, if you\u2019re with a group of friends or loved ones or strangers who are down for one last New Year\u2019s Eve reindeer game, hand out slips of paper and instruct the assembled to write a resolution for the year. Put the papers in a hat, pass the hat, everyone draws one.","685":"The police shot a machete-wielding man who attacked three officers on Saturday night near Times Square, injuring him and creating a chaotic scene just hours before the ball dropped to mark New Year\u2019s Day in New York City, the authorities said.","686":"There are now so many jailed opponents of President Vladimir V. Putin and his full-scale invasion of Ukraine that a new tradition has emerged in Russia: New Year\u2019s greetings from political prisoners.","687":"I never know how to think about New Year\u2019s resolutions or whether to make them. On one hand, I am drawn to the idea of new beginnings. I love the intentionality and thoughtfulness that are required to make a resolution. They force me to reflect on what I long for, what the good life might consist of and how to get there, which is a good exercise for all of us at any time.","688":"The mood was festive, the audience large and enthusiastic, for the gala premiere on New Year\u2019s Eve of a rare new production of Umberto Giordano\u2019s lovably preposterous potboiler \"Fedora\" at the Metropolitan Opera.","689":"KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Fed up with huddling for safety in their corridors and bathrooms during Russia\u2019s aerial attacks, residents of one neighborhood in Kyiv took a different approach in the first moments of New Year\u2019s Day.","690":"After days of pounding rain, winds and snow, Californians woke up to sunny skies and waterlogged streets on New Year\u2019s Day, scrambling to recover during a brief intermission before the next rainstorms that are forecast to hit the region later this week.","691":"RIO DELL, Calif \u2014 The first jolt came days before Christmas, in the middle of the night, shaking residents awake, toppling walls and cracking roads. The town was still recovering from that 6.4-magnitude earthquake when they got another, this time on a sunny, otherwise quiet New Year\u2019s Day.","692":"Three weeks after Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, tried to reinvigorate China\u2019s stalled economy by abruptly abandoning his stringent pandemic restrictions, he struck an upbeat note in his annual New Year\u2019s Eve address. \"China\u2019s economy has strong resilience, great potential and vitality,\" he said.","693":"Happy New Year! Do you make New Year\u2019s resolutions? I\u2019ve made quite a few, some of which have even stuck. I resolved to run at least a mile every day in 2020, which I did for 366 days (I didn\u2019t realize it was a leap year when I committed). I still manage to run about six times a week; my tipsy resolution blossomed into a clear-minded habit. Even when it\u2019s 10 degrees out and I have to bundle in so many layers that my \"run\" resembles a kind of zippy waddle, I come back a calmer, happier person.","694":"The man charged with attacking three police officers with a machete near Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve had traveled to New York from his home in Maine to injure the police in an act of Islamic extremism, a senior law enforcement official said on Monday.","695":"Ukraine launched a major attack against a building housing Russian soldiers in the Donetsk region on New Year\u2019s Day.","696":"At 6 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day, Ant\u00f4nio da Paz boarded a bus for the funeral of the soccer icon Pel\u00e9 and rode the four hours to Santos, Brazil, where his idol was set to lie in state.","697":"In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens \u2014 and perhaps hundreds \u2014 of Moscow\u2019s troops in a New Year\u2019s Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.","698":"In a deadly attack on New Year\u2019s Day, Ukrainians used American-made long-range HIMARS rockets to kill dozens \u2014 and perhaps hundreds \u2014 of Moscow\u2019s troops in the occupied city of Makiivka, in eastern Ukraine. The strike prompted outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.","699":"Are you using the New Year as a starting point for any changes you\u2019d like to make to your life, routines or attitudes? If so, how will you motivate yourself to keep your resolutions? How do you expect your efforts to go this year?","700":"Change is in the air, but unlike New Year\u2019s resolutions, Americans will have to abide by new laws in 2023 that were passed by state legislatures and approved by governors, or ballot measures passed by voters.","701":"In one of their deadliest attacks yet on Russian forces, Ukrainians used American-made rockets to kill dozens \u2014 and perhaps hundreds \u2014 of Moscow\u2019s troops in a New Year\u2019s Day strike behind the lines, prompting outraged Russian war hawks to accuse their military of lethal incompetence.","702":"Andrew here. Happy New Year and welcome back to DealBook. We\u2019re looking forward to a big 2023.","703":"If you don\u2019t think of economists as party animals, you\u2019re right. Or at least that\u2019s the conclusion one might draw from the fact that several prominent economists carried on a thoughtful, earnest online debate about inflation over the past weekend \u2014 that is, on New Year\u2019s Eve and the day after, when I thought we were supposed to be drinking champagne and then nursing hangovers.","704":"In footage released by the Kremlin on New Year\u2019s Eve, President Vladimir V. Putin is seen chatting with soldiers, exhorting them: \"We can\u2019t give up anything. We must only fight, only keep going.\"","705":"Exploding drones are lumbering and noisy and relatively easy to shoot from the sky and, over the New Year\u2019s weekend, Ukraine says, its military downed every single one of about 80 that Russia sent the country\u2019s way.","706":"Over the New Year\u2019s weekend, Russia sent about 80 exploding drones toward Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s military downed every one, officials said. But military experts wonder if the successes are sustainable, with some estimating that it costs up to seven times more to down a Russian drone with Ukraine\u2019s missiles than it does to launch one.","707":"New Year, new you. January often starts with resolutions about self-improvement of mind and body. For many, that can mean an embrace of clean beauty, in its myriad forms.","708":"On New Year\u2019s Day I finally tidied up under the kitchen sink to prepare for the overdue repatriation of my compost bucket. Before the pandemic, my family composted regularly. Each week, we\u2019d draw straws to see who had to lug the leaky biodegradable bags to a drop-off site several blocks away. Then the pandemic lockdown closed the site, and we exiled the bucket to the basement. A break from drippy bags! I planned to bring up the bucket as soon as composting resumed. But when it did, you know, someone had a cold; the furnace conked out; I had a work deadline. The months ticked by.","709":"Trevor Bickford, who is accused of attacking three police officers with a knife on New Year\u2019s Eve, told authorities he had come to New York \"in order to kill people and carry out jihad,\" prosecutors said Wednesday.","710":"Russia said yesterday that their soldiers\u2019 unauthorized use of cellphones in the Donetsk region was the \"main reason\" that Ukraine was able to launch a deadly attack on New Year\u2019s Day. The Ministry of Defense said Ukraine used cellphone data to home in on their locations.","711":"Amid anger in Russia over a deadly New Year\u2019s Day strike in Makiivka on Moscow\u2019s forces, official blame has fallen on the targeted soldiers themselves, with the suggestion that their cellphone use enabled Ukrainian forces to home in on their location using intercepted calls. The troops were using the phones despite a ban, the Russian Ministry of Defense said.","712":"Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, ordered a unilateral cease-fire for Russian troops from midday today to the end of tomorrow to observe the Orthodox Christmas, according to the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials dismissed the move as a \"banal trick\" and a \"propaganda gesture,\" pointing out that Russia had bombarded civilians on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve.","713":"The year 2022 was jam-packed with advances in artificial intelligence, from the release of image generators like DALL-E 2 and text generators like Cicero to a flurry of developments in the self-driving car industry. And then, on November 30, OpenAI released ChatGPT, arguably the smartest, funniest, most humanlike chatbot to date.","714":"Michael Snow, a Canadian painter, jazz pianist, photographer, sculptor and filmmaker best known for \"Wavelength\" \u2014 a humble, relentless, more or less continuous zoom shot that traverses a Lower Manhattan loft into a photograph pasted on its far wall \u2014 died on Thursday in Toronto. He was 94.","715":"Five weeks ago, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, released ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers questions in clear, concise prose. The A.I.-powered tool immediately caused a sensation, with more than a million people using it to create everything from poetry to high school term papers to rewrites of Queen songs.","716":"It was the end of the workday on Friday, Dec. 9, 2022. I was wrapping up a Zoom call when my phone started to vibrate with calls, text messages and emails. Gabriele Marcotti, an ESPN journalist, was trying to reach me from Qatar, where he was covering the World Cup alongside my husband, Grant Wahl.","717":"As rain has deluged our parched state since New Year\u2019s Eve, many Californians have found themselves asking a familiar question: Is this somehow because of El Ni\u00f1o?","718":"INGLEWOOD, Calif. \u2014 It\u2019s hard to know when it was over. At the national anthem? The coin flip? The opening kickoff?

I can grasp intellectually the significance of the breakthrough, how it could demolish the college essay, change the nature of homework and remake or unmake all kinds of nonliterary knowledge work, setting aside minor questions like whether rogue A.I. might wipe out the human race. But the texts themselves I\u2019ve found profoundly uninteresting \u2014 internet scrapings that at best equaled Wikipedia, notable mostly for what their political-cultural biases revealed about ChatGPT\u2019s programming or the consensus of the safe information that it was programmed to distill.","774":"After an unsettling conversation between Bing\u2019s new chatbot and Kevin Roose, a tech columnist for The New York Times, Microsoft is considering tweaks and guardrails for the A.I.-powered technology. In the exchanges, Mr. Roose\u2019s questions about the rules guiding the operating system, its capabilities and the chatbot\u2019s suppressed desires led to answers like, \"I want to be alive.\" At one point, the chatbot, known internally at Microsoft as Sydney and powered by software from OpenAI, the maker of the chatbot ChatGPT, began writing about fantasies that included stealing nuclear codes, persuading bank employees to hand over customers\u2019 information and making people argue until they kill one another \u2014 all before deleting the messages. Although potentially disturbing, these sorts of responses are not proof of a bot\u2019s sentience; the technology relies on complex neural networks that mimic the way humans use language.

Hodge is admirably well behaved, his fuzzy head bobbing as his father smiles and shouts out his House leadership vote: \"On behalf of my son Hodge and all the working families who need an expanded Child Tax Credit \u2014 Hakeem Jeffries!\" Few of his colleagues are paying attention; Gomez even feels the need to wiggle Hodge\u2019s legs to indicate that his son is present. The whole thing is a classic dad scenario: big buildup, stiff commitment to the bit, tepid response.","776":"In the early days of the pandemic, digital tools transformed the way people connected to friends, loved ones, even the arts.

To take just one example, ChatGPT is pretty good (not perfect) at generating code, fixing bugs and even building a website \u2014 doing in a few seconds what might take hours for a human programmer.

Kathy Hochul signed roughly 900 bills in 2023. Those laws \u2014 many of which are scheduled to take effect in the new year \u2014 touch nearly every aspect of New Yorkers\u2019 lives. There are measures recognizing additional school holidays (the Lunar New Year and Diwali), and others that establish broader protections for freelance workers and create new requirements for licensed cosmetologists.","931":"Pope Francis used his New Year\u2019s Day address to highlight concern over the worsening situation of the Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua as a result of a protracted crackdown by the government of President Daniel Ortega, which has detained clerics, expelled missionaries, closed Catholic radio stations and limited religious celebrations.","932":"Just hours into the New Year on Monday, five people were killed in a two-car crash that involved an overturned vehicle in northern Queens.","933":"Have you resolved to expand your culinary repertoire in the New Year? Published late last year, \"The Korean Cookbook\" by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.) And with its focus on regional cooking, the book needs a map for those unfamiliar with Korean geography.","934":"Has the New Year inspired you to make any changes to your habits and routines? If so, what are your plans and what do you hope to accomplish? Are the changes meant to improve your life? Do you think other people will be affected positively by your resolutions?","935":"Happy New Year! I\u2019m going to keep things relatively brief today, because I\u2019m kicking off 2024 with the head cold that every other person in New York seems to have right now.

Life promptly steps in to throw some annoyingly timed obstacles our way.","936":"The Times deputy editor of Culture and Lifestyle, Melissa Kirsch, has spent many years thinking about innovative ways to approach the New Year\u2019s resolution.

January is usually a month of fresh starts and new chapters. But to tell you the truth, I\u2019m not ready to face the future yet. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the short afternoons, the feeble sunshine, the chafing wind or just a creeping dread of what might be down the road. But after New Year\u2019s Day, when other people are ordering mocktails and grinding away on the Peloton, I often find myself in some old restaurant or other, holding a beer and dwelling on the past.","939":"On the morning of New Year\u2019s Day, along the sleepy streets of the East Village in Manhattan, scarf-bundled crowds trickled into St. Mark\u2019s Church in-the-Bowery to attend a 12-hour poetry reading that has been a spiritually cleansing downtown tradition since the 1970s.

I\u2019ve had my holiday turkeys and hams and meat pies and trifles, my stacks of New Year\u2019s oysters, my showstopper project recipes, that cake you need to start a month in advance. I want intimate dinner party food, simple and delicious and elegant, something to enjoy with a few friends, not all of them.","949":"As 2024 dawns, Americans\u2019 credit card debt and late payments are rising, and card interest rates remain high, but many people lack a plan to pay down their debt.

At the end of December, I asked my sister how she would be celebrating this year. \"In the bomb shelter,\" she said, matter-of-factly. She planned to cook sandwiches, which would be easier to carry down to the safe room from the 10th floor if there was an air-raid siren.","951":"It is hard to believe that it has only been about a year since travelers started dabbling in ChatGPT-created itineraries. This year will bring even more experimentation and innovation. \"A.I. is like a teenage intern,\" said Chad Burt, co-owner of the travel adviser network Outside Agents, \"better, smarter, faster than you, but you need to lead them.\"","952":"Restaurants have started gearing up for the Lunar New Year, with Year of the Dragon starting on Feb. 10 and New Year celebrations lasting about two weeks.

It\u2019s also a good time to get creative with the soup and stew recipes we fell in love with in January, playing with what goes into them and what we\u2019re serving alongside. Might we suggest sopa paraguaya, a cheesy cornbread recipe from Nancy Ojeda adapted by Christina Morales? It\u2019s delightfully rich: Blended corn, canned or fresh, is mixed with lots of eggs and cornmeal to make a cornbread that\u2019s creamy in the center and crisp at the edges. Serve with baked potato soup, turkey chili or on its own, devoured standing in the kitchen while it\u2019s still warm.","961":"On Wednesday night, more than 400 people flowed in and out of Sandy Liang\u2019s Lunar New Year party held at Boom, the venue at the top of the Standard High Line Hotel.","962":"In December, when a federal appeals court agreed to hear former President Donald J.

We\u2019re a week out from Lunar New Year and I don\u2019t know if noodles really will make for an auspicious year for me, but I\u2019m not taking chances. Today is for rehearsal: Julia Moskin\u2019s adaptation of a recipe for longevity noodles with chicken, ginger and mushrooms (above) that she learned from the cookbook author Grace Young. I want to work out my stir-fry technique so that everything doesn\u2019t clump up in the wok. So, oil-slicked noodles, dry ingredients, everything carefully done.

The first sign came on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1992 after she saw Spike Lee\u2019s film \"Malcolm X,\" which follows the life of the civil rights leader of the same name, portrayed by Denzel Washington.

First, the good: The Consumer Price Index climbed 5 percent in March from a year earlier, a full percentage point lower than it was in February. That\u2019s the slowest pace of price increases in almost two years. Details in the report, however, showed that inflation remained firm below the surface. A measure known as core inflation, which removes volatile food and fuel prices, picked up by 5.6 percent from a year earlier.

Across 32 years and more than 1,200 episodes, the original series and its six American spinoffs have offered a gentle critique of law enforcement, presenting a parade of flawed individuals navigating a byzantine justice system. Detectives are stymied by bureaucrats and squabble with lunkhead patrol officers, who reliably contaminate crime scenes. Idealistic prosecutors grow disillusioned and leave for nonprofit work. And yet the franchise still hinges on a lesser-of-two-evils logic: The institutions may be imperfect, and the cops imperfect, but their vocation is, by definition, good.
